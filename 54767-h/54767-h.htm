<p>This volume of the series finds the boys entering
upon manhood. Already, by integrity and
energy, have they secured the respect and confidence
of their employers and the community.</p>

<p>Isaac at sea, John behind the anvil, Fred in
trade, and Charlie in the shipyard. Fired by
the success of Lion Ben, and the spirit of enterprise
abroad, among a people who, having burst
the shackles of arbitrary power, were leaping
forward, with long strides, in pursuit of wealth,
knowledge, and power, they resolve to build a
vessel. When, by severe toil, and all manner
of make-shifts, they have completed the hull,
their means fail. Roused by necessity to still
greater efforts, they weave the canvas for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
sails in household looms, betake themselves to
the depths of the forest, there spend an entire
winter hunting and trapping. When the spring
opens, they build canoes of bark, and return by
water, unloading their furs, and carrying their
canoes round the rapids, thus obtaining sufficient
to accomplish their purpose.</p>

<p>So severe and protracted has been the conflict,
they call their vessel the Hard-Scrabble.</p>

<p>She arrives at Martinique during the contest
occasioned by the French revolution; war prices
are obtained for the cargo, affording a most
ample return. The property thus acquired is
used to create business for the benefit of the
community.

<small>INSTINCT TRIUMPHANT.</small></h2>

<p>We took leave of our young friends at the close
of the previous volume as they separated, John to
return to the blacksmith’s shop at Portland, Charlie
to the ship-yard at Stroudwater, while Fred
Williams remained in his store, which was in one
part of his father’s mill.</p>

<p>On Elm Island, Lion Ben was recovering from a
severe sickness, through which he had passed without
any other attendance than that of his wife, or
medicine save those simple remedies which nature
and experience had taught our mothers, or had
been learned from the red man.</p>

<p>As Ben was not reduced by bleeding or purgatives,&mdash;the
mode of medical practice prevalent in
those days,&mdash;he gained strength rapidly after the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
first few weeks, soon being able to go about the
house, and at length to extend his excursions to
the workshop and barn.</p>

<p>He soon discovered that the partridges were
missing; and upon asking Sally, she told him she
remembered having seen them a week before, but
had been so much occupied since that she had not
given any attention to them.</p>

<p>“Then they are gone,” replied Ben; “some owl
or hawk has carried them off.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they would go of their own
accord,” said Sally; “they seemed just as tame
and contented as the rest. Perhaps the coons
have got them. There are no skunks or foxes on
the island.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. I’m sorry, because Charlie will feel
bad about it.”</p>

<p>A few days after, Ben went out quite early in
the morning to the barn, and instantly returning,
called Sally to the door, and told her to stand still
and listen.</p>

<p>Soon a sound was heard in the woods, like that
of distant thunder.</p>

<p>“Do you hear that noise, Sally?”</p>

<p>“Yes; what is it?”</p>

<p>“It is one of Charlie’s partridges drumming.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
They have taken to the woods. Uncle Isaac said
they would, but I didn’t believe it. It’s all the
better; they will breed, and fill the island full in a
few years, and get their own living. Charlie will
be glad of it, for he will have them to shoot.”</p>

<p>“But won’t they fly away?”</p>

<p>“No; it’s too far from the main land. They
can’t fly but a little way before they have to light.
Thus we shall have coons, partridges, and gray
squirrels grow at our own door.”</p>

<p>“How nice it will be for Charlie to have all
these things right on the island! He loves dearly,
after supper, when he has done a good day’s work,
to go shooting. How much better it would be,
when he was tired and had not much time, to be
able to find game here, instead of pulling three or
four miles to some ledge or island!”</p>

<p>“Yes, this island is so large, we might have almost
anything, except wolves, bears, and foxes;
we shouldn’t want them.”</p>

<p>“Ben, what are you going to do with the corn-house
that Charlie made? You don’t want two
corn-houses.”</p>

<p>“I thought, when I was able, I would cut off the
legs, and make a pigsty of it. ’Twould make a
capital one. He needn’t have set it up on posts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
There are no mice here; but I suppose he thought
he must make it just like Uncle Isaac’s.”</p>

<p>“I never would make a pigsty of it in this
world, it is so handsome. Charlie took so much
pains with it, and was so proud of it when he got
it done. Give it to me.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of it?”</p>

<p>“O, I want to keep flax and yarn there in the
summer, and perhaps put the loom there.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll stop up the openings left to air the
corn, and you may have it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>“I’LL GIVE HIM QUICKSILVER.”</small></h2>

<p>The partial reformation in James Welch, to
which his father referred in the conversation with
Captain Rhines, already narrated, proved to be,
like too many of those delusive hopes to which
fond parents cling as drowning men to straws, void
of foundation; and the father, driven to extremity,
and perceiving at length that much of the criminal
conduct of the son lay at the door of his own
indulgence, determined to use sharper measures.</p>

<p>He informed James that he must go to Elm
Island for the summer, there struggle with his
habits, in the absence of outward temptation, or
leave his house forever; that his mother, utterly
discouraged, had come to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>James Welch, who, on the 15th of June, came
to Elm Island, and became an inmate of Ben’s
family, was a young man of superior general ability,
remarkable business talent, fine appearance,
affectionate, generous disposition, although of hasty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
temper, and exceedingly attractive in his manners.</p>

<p>He was passionately fond of all out-door recreations;
but a drunkard at two-and-twenty. He
proved a great accession to the society on Elm
Island, being an excellent singer, fond of children,
and rare company for Bennie, who was lonely
enough without Charlie. They all enjoyed themselves
finely, sitting on the door-stone at twilight,
and singing together.</p>

<p>It was difficult even for Ben, but especially for
Sally, to credit the stories they had heard of him.</p>

<p>As his father had predicted, the first time he
came in contact with Uncle Isaac, he conceived a
liking for him, which continually increased.</p>

<p>He soon learned to manage a boat; and Captain
Rhines let him take his, and keep her at the island,
although he took the precaution, unknown to
Welch, to cut her sails down.</p>

<p>He would take this boat, and go over to Uncle
Isaac’s Point; if he was working, off coat, and
help him, in order that Uncle Isaac might be able
to fish or hunt with him.</p>

<p>He was naturally of a mechanical turn, and
would amuse himself in the shop with the tools.
Indeed, he was, with one exception, universally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
liked. He could not make friends with Tige, and
never dared to go to Captain Rhines’s in the evening.
With Sailor and Uncle Isaac’s Watch he
was a sworn friend; but Tige would have nothing
to do with him, and it was by no means safe to
<i>force</i> attentions upon Tige.</p>

<p>His attenuated limbs became round and plump
with muscle; his haggard cheeks began to crimson;
his step regained the elasticity, and his eye the fire,
of youth, which seemed forever to have departed.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac said he was as fine-looking and
good-hearted a fellow as ever the sun shone upon.</p>

<p>He learned, after upsetting several times, to
manage the birch. Uncle Isaac permitted him to
keep her at the island. Thus he had two boats,
and when it was calm, would take her, paddle over
to the main, and up the river, following all its
windings. In one of these excursions, he discovered
Pleasant Cove. Enraptured with the beauty
of the spot, he carried his canoe around the fall,
and paddled up the brook into the pond.</p>

<p>“Ben,” said he, on his return, “I have known
people spend thousands of dollars to make a
beautiful place, and not obtain anything half so
fine as the place I have seen to-day. I mean to
ask father to buy it. Would Charlie sell it?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>“When he sells himself,” replied Sally. “Besides,
there’s another party as much attached to it
as he is.”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean to sketch it, at any rate.”</p>

<p>Matters went on thus pleasantly for some time.
James would often start off, taking a luncheon,
fishing-lines, cooking utensils, and be gone a day
or two, sometimes longer, camping in the woods,
sleeping at Captain Rhines’s or Uncle Isaac’s, just
as it happened. Sometimes the first thing they
would know of him, he would make his appearance
at the breakfast-table, having come across in the
night.</p>

<p>His parents, who were informed of his good
doings by Captain Rhines, and especially of his
friendship with Uncle Isaac, with that parental
credulity ever prone to catch at the shadow of a
hope, were greatly encouraged.</p>

<p>“No one,” wrote his father, in reply, “could like
Uncle Isaac so well as I know he does unless
there was some good in them, and some hope of
them.”</p>

<p>Captain Rhines shook his head. He had seen,
in a life spent at sea, too much of the strength of
the appetite for liquor to leap at conclusions.</p>

<p>One morning after breakfast, as Ben was going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
to the field, he saw James, as they now called him,
paddling out of the cove in the birch. Two days
after, about ten o’clock in the forenoon, Uncle
Isaac espied from his point the birch half way over
to Elm Island. She was apparently empty, drifting
down the bay with the tide.</p>

<p>He waited a while, and seeing no one coming
after her, took his boat, and pulled off, when he
found James Welch flat on his back in the bottom
of her, and an empty bottle beside him. He was
completely stupefied with liquor. It appeared afterwards
that he had gone along shore gunning,
camped a night in the woods, and the next afternoon
came upon some men who were making potash,
and well provided with liquor. They offered
him some. This awoke the slumbering appetite.
He bought a bottle, and kept drinking. Through
the aid of that Providence which seems to watch
over drunkards, he made out to get into the birch,
and push off, when becoming helpless, the tide was
drifting him to sea. Uncle Isaac, with a sad heart,
towed the birch, with its occupant, to the island.
Ben took him up in his arms, carried him to the
house, and laid him on the bed.</p>

<p>Sally, who had felt greatly encouraged, was
affected to tears.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>“Stop to dinner, Uncle Isaac.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stop and rest, and cool off, Benjamin; but
as for eating, this thing has taken away all my
appetite.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for his poor parents; but I’m afraid
it’s no use.”</p>

<p>“O, Ben, it’s too much! It’s more than I can
bear to see so fine a young fellow go to ruin right
before my eyes! We’ve done all that can be done
in the way of counsel, coaxing, and kindness. I
mean to give him a dose of quicksilver.”</p>

<p>When James Welch recovered his senses, his
reflections were most harrowing. Having formed
a strong and healthy attachment to Ben and his
family, he was deeply mortified when he reflected
upon the exhibition he had made of himself before
them. But he was, most of all, attached to Uncle
Isaac, and loved him with all his heart. How he
got back to the island, whether Uncle Isaac knew
what had taken place, were questions he could not
solve, and was too proud to ask.</p>

<p>He went to the cove. The birch was there.
He then concluded that Ben went in search of and
picked him up; that Uncle Isaac knew nothing
about it, and had half a mind to go over and see
him; but he was by no means sure that Ben would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
permit it. His pride inclined him to remain where
he was, rather than ask or attempt to go and be
prevented. Ben had not made the most distant
allusion to his conduct; but he saw he kept his
eye on him, and knew he was in the hands of a
giant.</p>

<p>He wandered over the island a day or two, miserable
enough, and for the first time in his life
really sorry for his acts. While in this state of
suspense and misery, uncertain whether he was a
prisoner or not, Uncle Isaac came to the island,
apparently as cordial as ever, and invited him to
go after fowl. The invitation was most joyfully
accepted, and they set out. He now felt sure that
Uncle Isaac was ignorant of all that had taken
place; but he was soon undeceived.</p>

<p>They killed a few birds; then went to Pleasant
Cove, and landing, sat down to rest beneath the
birches at Cross-root Spring, when Uncle Isaac, in
a kind but commanding tone, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“James, I was at work last Tuesday forenoon
on the eend of my p’int, and happening to look off
in the bay, I saw the birch drifting about. Going
to see what was the matter, found you dead drunk
in the bottom of her. Don’t you feel ashamed of
yourself?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>The fiery temper of the young man was roused
in an instant by this blunt question. Forgetting
the usual urbanity of his manners, and the deference
he always paid to his friend, he exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>“What concern is that to you? I should like
to know what business you have to go nosing
round after me, watching my proceedings?”</p>

<p>“The birch was mine. I had a perfect right,
and it was my duty, to look after my own property
when I saw it adrift and likely to go to sea. It is,
moreover, the duty of every one who loves his
neighbor to give seasonable advice, and even to
reprove, in a kind spirit, a young man who is ruining
himself, bringing disgrace upon his friends, and
setting a bad example to those who have had fewer
privileges.”</p>

<p>“Murch, you ignorant, meddlesome old codger
you! Because I have permitted you some liberties,
you presume on my condescension to insult
me. But,” he replied, with an awful oath, “I’ll
make you know your place! I’ll trample you under
my feet!”</p>

<p>“Please not swear in my presence, young man.
It’s wrong, and hurts my feelings. I am indeed
ignorant, as you say, having had but few privileges;
but I certainly have the advantage of you in one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
thing. I have made the best use I know how of
the few a kind Providence has given me. Neither
am I a pauper, swearer, drunkard, or thief.”</p>

<p>“This to <i>me</i>, you old villain!” exclaimed Welch,
leaping to his feet, with both fists clinched, and
livid with passion. “Take every word of that
back, and humbly ask my pardon, or I’ll beat you
like a dog.”</p>

<p>A quiet smile played over the features of Uncle
Isaac, as he replied, “I do love to see a mud-puddle
in a squall.”</p>

<p>Pulling a bulrush out of a clump that grew beside
the spring, he flung it across one of the enormous
roots of the birch that towered above them.</p>

<p>“You speak of beating me, young man. What
that rush is to this birch would you be in my
hands. You have drunk too much liquor to have
any strength, even if you was made for it, which
you are not. Just open these fists, which look
more like potato-balls than anything else. Sit
down on that flat rock, and listen to what I have
to say, or I shall be tempted to call you a fool,
which is contrary to Scripture. ‘A little pot soon
biles over.’ If I had no more government over
myself than you have, I should set you on your
head in this spring, when you would probably die
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
by water, which is a much more respectable death
than the one you seem to be preparing yourself
for.”</p>

<p>“I will leave you, at any rate,” replied Welch, in
a much more subdued tone; for he now bethought
himself that he was in the woods, miles from any
human being, and entirely in the power of a man
whom he had most grossly insulted and threatened,
and whose forbearance he might well distrust.</p>

<p>“No, you won’t, except you can outrun a man
who has run down a bull-moose more than once or
twice. Did you hear me tell you to sit down?”</p>

<p>This was spoken in a tone so peremptory that
Welch obeyed at once, trembling with passion and
fear. James Welch was the idol of his parents,
and with an overweening affection by no means
uncommon, they had injured him by indulgence.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac, with that instinctive discernment
of character that can neither be learned nor taught,
had become aware of this. He had also, during
their long and familiar intercourse, obtained an
accurate knowledge of his character; as he would
have phrased it, “knew just how much of sound
wood there was in him to nail to.”</p>

<p>In view of the estimate thus formed, he had
resolved, as he told Ben, to give him quicksilver.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
This was a metaphoric term for stringent measures,
borrowed by Uncle Isaac from the practice of
physicians in his day, who were accustomed, in
severe cases of stoppage, where life was at stake, to
give quicksilver, which, by its weight, was sure to
force a passage, either by the ordinary channel, in
which event the patient recovered, or through the
walls of the intestines, when death was the result.
Thus it became a synonyme for “kill or cure.”</p>

<p>“I have said,” he continued, addressing his involuntary
listener, “that you are a profane swearer
and a drunkard. You have sworn in my presence.
I found you drunk in my birch, and it is well
known that these are your customary habits. You
are also a pauper. All property, everything that
goes to support life, in these parts, of any amount,
comes by the hard work of somebody,&mdash;either bone
labor or brain labor,&mdash;the labor of those who now
possess it, or of those from whom they inherited
it. That, I take it, you can’t deny, though you’ve
been to school and I ’aint. If a great, stout, hearty
feller, able to work, should go about the country,
eating the bread and wearing the clothes somebody
else earned, sleeping in the beds and warmed
by the fires that others provided, I take it there
wouldn’t be much doubt he was a pauper. That’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
just the way with you. You have eaten your
three meals a day ever since you was born, and
never earned one&mdash;no, not the salt that seasoned
them. That makes you out to be a pauper, and
it’s only your father that keeps you off the town.
Everybody who lives in society is bound to do
something for the society in which he lives&mdash;to
help bear its burden, and return something for the
benefits he receives from his neighbor, and be a
man among men. If he don’t do it, he’s not one
whit better than a thief, because he takes from the
common stock, eats up what ought to go to those
who ain’t able to earn it, and he makes no return
to society for what he draws. That’s just what
you are doing. You are useless, which seems to
me to be the meanest of all things, just about as
bad as being a drunkard or thief. You are not of
so much account as one of the clams in these flats,
or one of the frogs in this spring, for they answer
the end of their existence, and get an honest living,
which you don’t. Your father and mother begun
the world with nothing but their heads and hands;
and your father, moreover, had to support your
grandfather after his misfortune, and pay his debts;
but by industry, good principles, and the blessing
of God on their labor, they have got together a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
large property, and bear nobly their share of the
burdens of society. They have spent&mdash;I would
say, thrown away&mdash;a mint of money on you; given
you the best of larning, the best of opportunities
to go into business, do for yourself and others,
make something of yourself, and be looked up to;
but here you are at two-and-twenty years of age.
You’ve done nothing, you’re good for nothing, and
are going to the devil as fast as you can. Look at
Charlie Bell. He came to Elm Island a poor,
ragged orphan. See what he’s made of himself.
Talk about beating me! He could lay you on
your back faster than you could get up. Look at
Fred Williams. His father and mother never
knew how to treat a child, always hectoring and
fretting him; and now that his father is poorly,
and can do but little, that boy is at work from
daylight till dark, tending mill and store, making
fish, and seeing to the whole family; while you
are lazing round here, and can’t be trusted with
yourself, spending money you never earned a dollar
of, and killing the best of parents by inches. Look
at John Rhines. Yes, there’s a case in <i>pint</i>.
Look at that boy. He might have staid at
home, worked or played, laid abed or got up, as he
liked; for his father is indulgent, and as well off as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
yours, considering the small expense at which he
lives, and that he hasn’t got a reprobate son to
break his heart, and spend his hard earnings.
There he is, larning a blacksmith’s trade; up
early and late, sweating at the anvil. He scorns
to live on his father and grandsir’s substance.
Yes, and I may say your grandsir, for Elm Island
stood in his name, though he would have lost it
shortly, for the mortgage had nearly eaten it up,
when your father, from his own earnings, cleared
it. Yes, and took care of your grandsir in his old
age. When your father is in his grave, which will
be shortly unless you turn over a new leaf, you
will be living on what he leaves, gnawing the
bones of the dead&mdash;a business that I never knew
any dumb cretur to foller for a living but a wolf.
When you die, you’ll be no more missed than yonder
dead limb on that leaning beech. Now, if
you ain’t the smallest, pitifulest consarn there is
round here, I should like to know who is. There’s
another thing to be thought of, young man.
Where God has given great capacity and great
privileges, there’s great accountability; there’s
Holy Scripture for that. You <i>may</i> see the time
that you will wish you had been born a fool, or
not born at all. Come, it’s time we were going.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>Welch uttered not a word in reply, or on the
way home.</p>

<p>“What have you done to him?” asked Ben,
astonished at the appearance of Welch.</p>

<p>“Given him quicksilver, and it’s my opinion ’twill
either kill or cure. I do hope he’ll rally, for I love
the young man, though I felt it my duty to speak
quite plain to him. Indeed, I spoke quite plain
to him. He feels bad, Benjamin&mdash;all mixed up,
half crazy. We must let him sweat in his grease.
I shouldn’t wonder if he had a strong craving to
drown trouble in liquor. I think you had better
keep him on the island for a day or two.”</p>

<p>When James Welch got out of the boat, he
would have killed Uncle Isaac if he could. O,
how he wished he had the strength of Ben! But
God generally gives great strength, and a mild
temper in connection with it, to those who know
how to use it.</p>

<p>He declined coming to the supper-table, saying
he was unwell, and shutting himself in his room,
paced the floor till midnight, half demented. At
length there came over him a craving for liquor,
that he might escape from himself in the delirium
or stupor of intoxication. He knew the men who
were making potash had half a barrel of New England
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
rum in their camp, and went to the shore
resolved to go after some; but Ben had hauled the
boats so far up on the grass-ground that he was
unable to launch any of them.</p>

<p>Foiled in this, he bathed his burning forehead in
sea-water, and sat down on the rocks of the eastern
point, beneath the light of the stars.</p>

<p>No sound disturbed the night, save the low,
peculiar murmur of the tide, as it crept around the
foot of the cliff. The first paroxysm of passion
had passed away. He recalled the stinging truths
to which he had so unwillingly listened. They no
longer excited his anger, but appeared to him in a
very different light. His ingratitude to his parents
assumed a new aspect when presented by another,
and touched him to the heart. He could no longer
doubt that Uncle Isaac had faithfully portrayed
the estimation in which he was held by the community
at large.</p>

<p>No part of the conversation had touched him so
nearly, or cut so deep, as the parallel instituted between
himself and John Rhines. So completely
was he absorbed in thought, that the flowing tide
wet him to the knees unperceived.</p>

<p>In that still midnight hour, on the ocean cliff,
the better nature of James Welch won the victory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>“Uncle Isaac is right,” he said. “I have been a
drunkard, swearer, pauper, and thief. But from
this hour I am so no more.”</p>

<p>The gray light of morning was breaking, as,
utterly exhausted in mind and body, he flung himself
upon the bed, and sank into a profound sleep.
The next day Ben noted the change, and, surprised
by his offering to help him about his work, shoved
the boats into the water. In the course of the
week, James took the boat, and told Ben he was
going over to see Uncle Isaac. Before he had
fairly cleared the harbor, Ben entered the house at
a rate so unusual&mdash;for he was generally quite
moderate in his motions&mdash;and a face so replete
with joyful emotions, that Sally instantly exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why, Ben, what has happened?”</p>

<p>“The best thing that could happen. James has
gone over to Uncle Isaac’s.”</p>

<p>“Glory to God! He’s all right, or he never
would do that.”</p>

<p>James and Uncle Isaac came back together in
the afternoon, and before night there was another
auger-hole in the great maple.</p>

<p>Mr. Welch soon received a letter from his son,
telling him all that had transpired, and asking permission
to come home and go to work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>“Blessed be God!” exclaimed the delighted
father. “My last days are going to be my best
days.”</p>

<p>The reform proved permanent. James Welch
became a partner with his father, and assumed the
position for which his abilities qualified him. In
after years, he often visited the spot where this
singular scene was enacted, and the fountain was
ever after, by universal consent, called Quicksilver
Spring. In process of time the first syllable was
dropped, and many who are familiar with Silver
Spring are ignorant of the circumstances from
whence it derived its present name.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE BOYS CATCH THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE.</small></h2>

<p>After the departure of James Welch, nothing
worthy of note occurred to disturb the quiet enjoyment
of life on Elm Island.</p>

<p>Upon Ben’s recovery in the spring, he had hired
Robert Yelf for the summer.</p>

<p>Ben, Jr., who now began to manifest as great a
capacity for work as he had heretofore evinced for
mischief, made himself extremely useful. He assumed
the entire charge of the hens, ducks, geese,
and turkeys. In the spring he had dropped corn
and potatoes, and assisted in planting the garden.
He pulled up weeds, carried in wood and chips for
his mother, brought up the cows at night, and
drove them to pasture in the morning.</p>

<p>After haying, Ben and Yelf finished and rigged
the scow, which he had begun before he was taken
sick, and built a wharf in the cove, with an inclined
platform, over which cattle could be driven
to or from the scow. They also built a boat to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
take the place of the Perseverance, Jr., from Charlie’s
moulds, which was an easy matter, as the
work was all laid out.</p>

<p>When corn was in the milk, Sally Merrithew
ventured to marry Joe Griffin, who had been on
probation since he nearly finished Uncle Smullen.
Joe built his log house in the midst of a burn,
where he had planted corn and sowed wheat in
the spring. Ben gave Sally a cow and Captain
Rhines a pig to begin housekeeping with, and Ben
continued to pasture her sheep on Griffin’s Island,
as Joe had no land cleared for pasturing sheep,
and they were safe from the wolves on that island.
Elm Island gradually improved in beauty as Ben
ploughed and removed the stumps; and the fruit
trees in the new soil increased rapidly in size.</p>

<p>Amid these quiet occupations and enjoyments,
interspersed with tramps in the woods, bear-hunts
and gunning expeditions with Uncle Isaac, the
autumn, winter, and succeeding summer glided
rapidly away.</p>

<p>Very different was the appearance of Elm
Island, with its comfortable and roomy buildings,
broad fields covered with crops, now fast ripening
to the harvest, and vocal with the lowing of kine
and the song of birds, from its appearance the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
morning that Uncle Isaac and Joe Griffin landed
on the beach, and startled the herons from their
nests with the sound of the axe and the crash of
falling trees. Great as was the change that had
taken place on Elm Island, it was trifling in comparison
with that which obtained in respect to the
country at large.</p>

<p>Then it was a period of general poverty and
distress, although money was made by individuals
through superior energy, tact, and the irregularities
then existing in trade, and the intercourse of
nations,&mdash;Ben and his father being among the fortunate
ones.</p>

<p>Then there was neither revenue nor power to
collect any; the country oppressed with debt, and
no means to pay the old government under which
the war of the revolution had been fought&mdash;a
rope of sand&mdash;and no confidence in any quarter.
The states were deluged with importations of all
kinds&mdash;French gewgaws, English broadcloths,
iron, cordage, and duck from Russia and Sweden&mdash;which
people who had any means or credit were
but too much inclined to buy, despite the efforts
made by the government to discourage it, and encourage
home manufacture.</p>

<p>But now the Federal government was established,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
and Washington at its head, with power to
form treaties of amity and commerce, lay duties
and imposts; the national debt funded, affording an
opportunity for safe and profitable investments;
and banks were established. The spirit of the
country was up, and rose with a bound over all
obstacles, ready to grapple with any odds.</p>

<p>Nowhere was the exhilarating influence of the
times more eagerly responded to than in the District
of Maine,&mdash;with a vast extent of sea-coast,
and to a great degree aquatic population, and the
town of Portland in particular, then but recently
arisen from its ashes after its bombardment by the
British, and incorporated, with an unrivalled harbor,
a back country almost one unbroken forest of
timber of all kinds, for which there was an abundant
demand at high prices in Europe and the West
Indies, with extensive water-power for its manufacture;
vast quantities of ship-timber, with mechanics
both native and imported; and a population
whose energies were <i>then</i>, and have <i>continued</i>
to be, equal to every demand made upon them.</p>

<p>This town was among the first to avail itself of,
and profit by, these altered circumstances. Mills
were going up on every waterfall, wharves building,
distilleries erecting, the keels of vessels laid, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the roads thronged with teams dragging the masts,
spars, and boards to the place of shipment. Mails
were established, and a newspaper published. It
is easy to perceive what effect these new excitements
must make upon boys so impressible as
Charlie and John, at work in the midst of such
scenes. They read the Cumberland Gazette, which
Mr. Starrett took; also the Columbian Centinel,
printed at Boston, which he borrowed from one of
his neighbors; a Portsmouth paper, which was sent
to a Portsmouth man who worked in the shop.
They listened with sharp ears to every word of the
excited conversation that occurred within their
hearing, in that stirring period, when the state
of Europe, its politics, its markets, the troubles in
France, and their bearing upon the prosperity of
America, became subjects of discussion, and were
every whit as much interested as the actual participants,
and, when they were alone, talked over
all they had heard between themselves.</p>

<p>John was now working as a journeyman, and
received four-and-six a day. Charlie found an excellent
employer in Mr. Foss, who instructed him
by every method in his power, and put him on the
best work, as he found that he was capable of doing
it, and also increased his wages.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>Fishing, too, had received the same impulse as
other pursuits, not merely by reason of the increased
market for fish, and increased facilities for
carrying them to foreign parts, but also in consequence
of a bounty granted by the government.
And Fred Williams, who, to his traffic in fish and
groceries, had added the buying of potash, beef,
and pork, was steadily acquiring.</p>

<p>As the country became cleared, great numbers
of cattle were raised, and salted beef found a
ready market in the West Indies for the use of
the slavers.</p>

<p>Potash was in great demand in Europe. Fred
was able to barter goods for potash, sell it in Boston
at a large advance, and thus make a double
profit&mdash;making more in that way than by all his
other traffic.</p>

<p>Charlie, finding that the price of land was rising,
sent word to Uncle Isaac to purchase enough more
of the heavy pine growth abutting on the back
part of his lot to make, with what he already had,
four hundred acres; but Uncle Isaac bought the
whole lot, and informed Charlie he might have of
him, at the price he gave, enough to make out his
four hundred acres. Charlie also bought Birch
Island of the state, as he did not relish the idea of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
being a squatter; and the whole island, containing
six acres of first-rate land, covered with a heavy
growth of birch, an excellent harbor, and a noble
spring of water, cost him only nine shillings. But
in those days land on a small island like that was
but lightly valued, while birch wood was not considered
worth thanking God for.</p>

<p>“Charlie,” said John, in one of those confidential
interviews that generally occurred on Saturday
night, “couldn’t you build a vessel now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I could. I lined up the
Freebooter, while Mr. Foss was laying the keel
of another vessel.”</p>

<p>“What is the reason we couldn’t build a vessel?
I know I could do the iron-work.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we might do the work if somebody
would find the money. It takes a heap of money
to build a vessel and fit her for sea.”</p>

<p>“But couldn’t we build one, take time enough,
and sell her just as you do the boats&mdash;without
rigging her?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we might do.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Build one, take our own time for it,&mdash;I’ve got
timber enough on my land to build and load ever
so many,&mdash;then keep a part of her, and sell the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
rest; put our work, my timber, and what little
money we could muster, against somebody else’s
money.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we could do that; but I should much
rather have her to ourselves,&mdash;say you, and I,
and Fred.”</p>

<p>“We might go to work, cut the timber, and set
up a vessel, get her along as far as our means
would allow, then let her stand till we could earn
more. But we should want a captain.”</p>

<p>“That is true; and perhaps Seth Warren or
Sydney Chase might take a part, and go in her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that would be a quarter apiece.”</p>

<p>“Charlie, I heard Captain Pote say, in this very
house last Saturday night, that if anybody could
get a load of lumber to the West Indies, at the
right time, he could make enough to build another
vessel.”</p>

<p>“How much do you suppose it costs to build a
vessel?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; the rigging and sails are the
most. You can build the hull very cheap, so that
she will last a little while without much iron fastening;
but you must have good rigging and sails,
or else you are liable to lose vessel and cargo.”</p>

<p>“How much?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>“I know Mr. Foss built a vessel for Weeks and
Tucker, hull and spars, and found everything, for
fifteen dollars a ton, delivered at Pearson’s breast-work,
in Portland.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen hundred dollars for the hull and spars
of a vessel of a hundred tons?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m sure we could build a sloop of fifty.”</p>

<p>“But a sloop of fifty tons wouldn’t be of any
use to carry such bulky cargoes as boards, spars,
ton-timber, and molasses, which is what we must
do.”</p>

<p>“Ye-e-e-e-s.”</p>

<p>Here the conversation came to an abrupt termination
by Charlie’s falling asleep.

<small>NEWS FROM HOME.</small></h2>

<p>As the summer was drawing to a close, the
evenings grew longer, and these conversations
were renewed from time to time, as the boys
were excited by hearing of some great slap made
by an enterprising captain, or some smuggler
making a fortune in one or two trips to Havana.
Captain Starrett, the brother of John’s master,
was an inveterate smuggler. The house was resorted
to by seafaring men, masters and mates,
and the boys had abundant opportunities to gain
information in respect to voyages and profits.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Foss and Mr. Starrett owned a small
part of several vessels, which afforded the boys an
excellent opportunity to obtain accurate and reliable
information, of which they did not hesitate
to avail themselves.</p>

<p>As there were no mails east of Portland, the
only way in which the boys obtained letters from
home was by some coasting vessel. When they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
did get one, it was correspondingly valued, read
and re-read, commented upon, and formed the
subject of conversation for a month. John received
a letter one afternoon, and on opening it,
found enclosed one from Ben to Charlie.</p>

<p>The moment he was done work at night, he
went to Stroudwater to see Charlie, spend the
night with him, and walk in before work-hours in
the morning. To the no small delight of the boys,
they were informed that it was nearly two years
since they had been at home, with the exception
of the time when Ben was sick; that neither
Captain Rhines’s family nor Ben and Sally could
stand it any longer, and they must come home,
and make a good visit.</p>

<p>“Ain’t I glad!” cried John.</p>

<p>“Ain’t I!” replied Charlie. “I wanted to go
bad enough, but I didn’t like to lose my time,
and was afraid Mr. Foss would think I was a
baby.”</p>

<p>“That was just the way with me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Foss had a vessel that would be ready to
launch in a fortnight, and wanted Charlie to stay
till after launching. They wrote home by a
coaster, that was to sail the next day, that they
would start in a fortnight in the boat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Perseverance, Jr., was hauled up,
repaired, re-painted, and put in first-rate order for
the cruise. During that fortnight there was but
one subject of conversation, and that never grew
stale&mdash;<i>home</i>, and what they should do when they
got there.</p>

<p>“There’ll be partridges and coons, lots of ’em,
to shoot on Elm Island, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be bears on my land, John.”</p>

<p>“Won’t Tige wag his tail off?”</p>

<p>“Won’t Bennie and the baby have a time?”</p>

<p>“What will Fred say?”</p>

<p>“We shall see Uncle Isaac!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Joe Griffin and Henry.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if they’ve got any boat there that’ll
outsail the Wings of the Morning?”</p>

<p>“Do you calculate to come back here, Charlie?”</p>

<p>“Do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; Mr. Starrett wants me to. I
shall come if you do.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Foss <i>wants</i> me, too; but I can do better
building boats at home than I can working in the
ship-yard. I’ve learned about all I can here.”</p>

<p>“I could get just as good wages at Wiscasset
as I can here, and go home every few weeks.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>“Ain’t we going home in a glorious time of
year? The sea-fowl will be coming along.”</p>

<p>“There will be berries.”</p>

<p>“Pickerel in my pond.”</p>

<p>“O, Charlie, I’ll tell you what we’ll do&mdash;you,
and I, and Fred.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“We’ll borrow Uncle Isaac’s birch, and go up
the brook to the falls, then take her on our
shoulders, and carry her round the falls, then
follow all the crooks of the brook till we come to
the pond. It is real crooked; I dare say ’twould
be three or four miles.”</p>

<p>“That would be something we never did; and
the water in the pond will be so warm to go in
swimming!”</p>

<p>“Yes; I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>“O, John, I tell you, we’ll go on to Indian
Island, and make a birch of our own&mdash;a smasher.
I know I can make one.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll get Uncle Isaac to work the ends
with porcupine quills.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall have the Perseverance, Jr., to
go outside in and fish, and take the girls to sail.
We’ve got a boat now&mdash;no old dugout&mdash;and
we’ll go exploring just where we like&mdash;way down
the coast.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>As is often the case with boys, they planned
employments and enjoyments enough to occupy a
whole summer, while they intended to allow themselves
not more than three weeks of vacation at
the outside.</p>

<p>“I felt real bad, John, when father wrote that
the partridges had gone; but come to think, I’m
glad of it, ’cause they’ll breed in the woods, and
if I want to try to tame some more, I can find the
eggs.”</p>

<p>“I should be; because when it blows, and you
can’t get off the island, or any time after supper,
you can take the gun, and find them in the yellow
birches.”</p>

<p>While the boys are revelling amid these anticipated
pleasures, let us note what effect the announcement
of their coming produced at home.

<small>TIGE’S NOSE BETTER THAN THE CAPTAIN’S SPY-GLASS.</small></h2>

<p>No sooner had Captain Rhines received the
letter, informing him of the time at which they
expected to set out, than he hurried home with it,
and then, getting into his boat, made sail for Elm
Island, where his information caused no little
gratification. He had scarcely left the shore on
his errand, when Elizabeth made the discovery
that there was not a needle in the house fit to sew
with, nor one grain of beeswax.</p>

<p>“You must go to the store, Elizabeth, and get
some needles and wax,” said her mother; “and
tell Fred to send me half a yard of cloth from the
piece I looked at yesterday. I must finish John’s
waistcoat before he comes home.”</p>

<p>Thus Fred was made acquainted with the tidings,
and through him Uncle Isaac, Henry Griffin,
and Joe.</p>

<p>“I do believe,” said Mrs. Rhines, “that Tige
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
knows what is going on, for every time John’s
name is mentioned, he wags his tail, and seems
uneasy.”</p>

<p>“Knows!” replied the captain; “to be sure he
does. Any fool of a dog might know as much as
that; and Tige has forgot more than most dogs
know. Here, Tige&mdash;go find John.”</p>

<p>The dog instantly ran to the door, and barked
to be let out. After making a tour of the premises,
he came in, ran up to John’s bedroom, and
came down with one of his jackets in his mouth,
and laid it at his master’s feet.</p>

<p>“See that, and tell me he don’t know what we
are talking about!”</p>

<p>Ever since Tige had saved little Fannie from
drowning, she had been in the habit of making
him frequent visits, bringing with her something
she knew he would like to eat. Tige never returned
the visits, for it was not in accordance with
his habits and principles ever to leave the premises,
except sent on an errand by his master, or with
one of the family; but he always received her
with great cordiality. Fannie could talk plain
now. Ever since the promise to her from Captain
Rhines, that Tige never should be whipped, do
what he would, she had entertained a very high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
opinion of the captain, who loved dearly to play
and romp with her.</p>

<p>While Captain Rhines and his wife were conversing,
Fannie came trudging along, with gingerbread
and meat in her basket for Tige.</p>

<p>“Good morning, my little woman! Have you
come to see me, and have a good frolic?”</p>

<p>“Fannie came to see Tige.”</p>

<p>“Then you think more of Tige than you do
of me?”</p>

<p>“I love Tige.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact.”</p>

<p>I’ve no doubt Tige by this time had his nose in
Fannie’s basket.</p>

<p>“Captain Rhines, you know Tige loves babies.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know we have a little baby?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’ve come for Tige to go and see it.”</p>

<p>“What a comical little thing you are! Well, I
suppose he must go. Then you’re not going to
stop and play with me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; because Tige wants to see the baby.”</p>

<p>“He won’t go with her,” said Mrs. Rhines,
“without some of us go with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he will,” said the captain, “if I tell him
to, and give him something to carry.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>“Then you must give him something that he
won’t eat, or she’ll give every mite of it to him.”</p>

<p>Captain Rhines filled Fannie’s basket with
apples, and put in some flowers, and Mrs. Rhines
gave her some cake to eat herself. Tige took the
basket in his mouth, and away they went; but
Fannie gave him all her cake before she got
home.</p>

<p>She made out to get him into the house, where
he licked the baby’s face, and frightened it half to
death, and then set out for home, refusing the
most urgent solicitations to stay to dinner.</p>

<p>Tige also had the promise of going over to Elm
Island again, to see the baby there.</p>

<p>The heart of Captain Rhines was bound up in
John. Two days had now passed since the time
fixed in his mind for their arrival. He became
very uneasy. Every few moments he would catch
the spy-glass, and run out on the hill to look.</p>

<p>“Why, Captain Rhines,” said his wife, “I don’t
think you need laugh any more at us women for
being nervous and fidgety when our friends are
away! I’m sure you beat us all. Old Aunt Nabby
Rideout, of Marblehead, that they say used to
bank up her house with tea-grounds, never begun
with you! You can’t expect folks that are coming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
by water to come just at the time they set.
You must have patience.”</p>

<p>“Patience! I’ve had patience to kill.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’ve had a head wind, or calm.”</p>

<p>“No, they haven’t! I know how the winds
have been. They’ve had as good and steady a
wind as ever blew&mdash;just the breeze for a boat.”</p>

<p>The next day after this conversation, the captain,
after running in and out half of the forenoon
with the spy-glass in his hand, said, “Wife, I
won’t look any more till they come. I’m going
to have patience; but there’s Tige been laying all
the morning before the door, with his nostrils to
the wind.”</p>

<p>He put the glass in the brackets, and taking up
a book, began to read. He had hardly commenced,
when a tremendous roar, ending in a
prolonged howl, rang through the house.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” cried the captain; “why couldn’t I
have seen them? I’ve been looking with all the
eyes I’ve got the whole morning;” and rushing to
the door, he caught a glimpse of Tige’s tail disappearing
round the corner of the wood-pile.</p>

<p>To his astonishment, there was no boat to be
seen in the cove, nor in the offing. Turning round
to learn what had become of Tige, he espied him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
going at full speed across the orchard, clearing logs
and fences at a leap, for the main road, emitting
sharp, short barks as he ran, and was soon lost to
view around a point of thick woods. The captain
sat down on a log to see what would turn up next,
and in a quarter of an hour was joined by all the
family.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose it means?” asked Mrs.
Rhines.</p>

<p>“<i>Means?</i> It means they are coming along the
road. Tige has known it since six o’clock this
morning. I knew he did by his actions, and that
was what made me so patient.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you was very patient; but what has become
of their boat?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Perhaps she has sprung a-leak,
or they run on to some reef and punched a hole in
her. Here they come!” roared the captain, as
Tige’s voice was again heard. He was evidently
returning, and the barking sounded louder and
louder. In a few minutes Tige appeared in view
around the point of woods.</p>

<p>He presented a comical appearance. He was
coming sidewise, doubled all up like a rainbow, or
the colonel’s horse prancing at the head of the
regiment general-muster morning, caused by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
effort to keep one eye on the boys and the other
on Captain Rhines and his company, and progress
at the same time.</p>

<p>These anxiously-expected ones came in sight,
each with a pack on his back. John also bore a
gun on his shoulder, and Charlie a hatchet in his
hand.</p>

<p>“They have travelled all the way!” exclaimed
Captain Rhines.</p>

<p>“What are we thinking about! Here it is, most
noon, not a thing done towards dinner, and these
poor boys tired and half starved!” said Mrs.
Rhines.</p>

<p>This was the signal for a general stampede in
the direction of the house.</p>

<p>“I’ll get some dry wood, and have a fire in no
time, wife.”</p>

<p>Then, with the combined efforts of these practised
hands, a great fire was roaring in the chimney,
the teakettle boiling, the table in the floor,
and eggs frying by the time that Tige burst into
the room, followed by the boys.</p>

<p>“Why, John, how you’ve grown!” said Captain
Rhines, twirling him round on his heel; “and
Charlie, too; I believe he has grown more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
you have. There was more chance for it. You
was as big as a moose before.”</p>

<p>“I guess hard work agrees with both of you,”
said Mrs. Rhines.</p>

<p>“It always did,” replied Charlie. “We’re the
boys for that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added John, “none of the western boys
can lay us on our backs, either. Mother, do your
hens lay well?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but what makes you ask that?”</p>

<p>“Because, if you think there’s eggs enough in
that kettle, you’re very much mistaken.”</p>

<p>“There’s half a bushel in the buttery,” said his
father. “They’ll stay your stomachs, and after
dinner I’ll kill a fat wether I’ve got in the barn.”</p>

<p>The captain could not well have given stronger
evidence of hospitality and glad welcome than by
his resolve to kill a wether, that would afford
double the wool which could be sheared from an
ordinary sheep, as will be evident if we reflect a
moment upon the state of affairs at that period.
Before the war of the revolution, when the British
government was imposing onerous taxes upon our
fathers, prohibiting American manufactures, and
endeavoring to compel them to purchase those of
the mother country, they not only threw the tea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
overboard, but in every way attempted to clothe
themselves, that they might be independent of
Great Britain. In order to be provided with
material for cloth, the people of Massachusetts
resolved to eat no lamb, and not a butcher dared
to offer any for sale. Bounties were offered for
wolves, flocks of sheep were increased by every
possible means, great quantities of flax were
raised, and every household was transposed into
a manufactory, where wool and flax were carded,
spun, and wove, and colored with barks and roots
found in the woods.</p>

<p>“Save your money, and save your country,”
became a proverb.</p>

<p>After the war, and at the period of our tale,
when the country was oppressed with debt, and its
infant manufactures were struggling for existence,
when Great Britain, while excluding us from her
West India ports, was deluging the country with
her manufactures in order to effectually crush our
own, all true patriots, and the government to the
extent that lay in its power, strove to sustain the
old spirit of independence, and raise wool and flax.
Captain Rhines very rarely, and Uncle Isaac
never, killed a lamb; but on this occasion
the glad father was willing to slaughter even a
wether.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>Evil kills the home-feeling; virtue deepens and
strengthens it. The fact that the presence of
these boys added so much to the happiness of
home, and that they were so happy to get home,
was a fine tribute both to their heart and principles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>TELLING AND HEARING THE NEWS.</small></h2>

<p>“What’s the news, father?” asked John, when
the protracted meal was at length finished.
“Who’s dead? who’s married?”</p>

<p>“Are all well on the island?” interposed
Charlie.</p>

<p>“All are first-rate on the island. Aunt Molly
Bradish, good old soul! has gone to heaven. She
was buried a week ago Tuesday. Nobody else
has died that you are much acquainted with; but
old Mrs. Yelf is very sick, and you must go and
see her. She has talked about you ever since you
have been gone, and will never forget the good
turns you did her after her husband died.”</p>

<p>“How is Uncle Isaac, father?”</p>

<p>“Smart as a steel trap; has killed lots of birds,
and last winter bears, deer, and three wolves; and
the last time I rode by there, I saw a seal-skin
stretched on the barn.”</p>

<p>“How is Fred?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>“First-rate.”</p>

<p>“Has he built a new store?”</p>

<p>“A real nice one.”</p>

<p>“And put a T on the wharf?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you talk some, Charlie?” asked
John. “You sit there just as mum!”</p>

<p>“He can’t get a word in edgewise,” said Mrs.
Rhines, “you talk so fast yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll hold my tongue.”</p>

<p>“There’s another hole bored in your great
maple, Charlie,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“There is? Who bored it?”</p>

<p>“Guess.”</p>

<p>“Joe Bradish?”</p>

<p>“Guess again.”</p>

<p>“Sydney Chase?”</p>

<p>“Guess again. O, you’ll never guess! James
Welch;” and she told him the story.</p>

<p>“I’ll name that spring ‘Quicksilver Spring.’”</p>

<p>“Father,” said Mary, “you haven’t told the boys
who is married.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, their questions follow each other so
fast, I lose my reckoning. Joe Griffin.”</p>

<p>“Joe!” cried John. “Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“Right on the shore, between Pleasant Point
and Uncle Isaac’s, in a log house.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>“Then he’ll be close to me,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes, only two lots between. They say he’s
raised the biggest crop of wheat that was ever
raised in this town, and has got the handsomest
crop of corn growing.”</p>

<p>“Then Sally mustered up courage to marry
him?”</p>

<p>“<i>Marry him!</i> She may thank her stars she got
him. Let them talk as much as they like about
his being a harum-scarum fellow. There’s not a
smarter, better-hearted fellow in this place, nor a
man of better judgment. He showed a good deal
more sense than our Ben, who, folks think, is all
sense.”</p>

<p>“How, father?”</p>

<p>“Why, Ben built his house, and then set his
fire, and liked to have burned up his house, baby,
and all the lumber that went into his vessel, and
did scorch his wife; but this harum-scarum fellow
burnt his land over first, and put something in the
ground to live on.”</p>

<p>“They say,” said Mrs. Rhines, “that they are
the most affectionate pair that ever was. Joe
thinks there is not her equal in the world.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what he ought to think, wife. I
hope it will last, and not be with them as it was
with Joe Gubtail and his Dorcas.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p>“Why, he said, when they were first married,
he loved her so well he wanted to eat her up, and
now he wishes he had.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will, for they have been fond
of each other since they were children, and ought
to be well acquainted.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t said anything about Flour, Captain
Rhines,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“O, he ain’t Flour any longer. He lives in a
frame house on his own land, is Mr. Peterson, has
money at interest, can read, write, and cipher, and
is master-calker at Wiscasset.”</p>

<p>“Good! Won’t we go over and see him?
Didn’t they cut up some rusties on Joe when
he was married?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I should have thought the boys would have
done something to him to pay him up for all his
tricks, for there’s hardly anybody in town but has
something laid up against him.”</p>

<p>“So should I,” said John. “I should have
thought they would have given him a house-warming,
and paid up old scores.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there were good reasons why they
didn’t.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>“What were they?”</p>

<p>“One was, that everybody loves and respects
his wife; another, that Joe had been very quiet
for a long time before he was married, and they
didn’t quite like to stir him up again, for fear they
might get the worst of it, get into a bear-trap,
or he might fire a charge of peas or salt into
them. Joe Griffin isn’t a very safe fellow to
stir up.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Charlie, “they thought as I
did about the bear at Pleasant Cove&mdash;if you’ll let
me alone I’ll let you alone.”</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> can tell you some news,” said Mrs. Rhines.</p>

<p>“Let’s have it, mother.”</p>

<p>“Isaac has arrived.”</p>

<p>“Isaac Murch?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And has come back mate,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“In Boston; but he’s coming home to stay some
time. They’re going to heave the vessel out, recalk,
and overhaul her thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“Where is Henry Griffin?”</p>

<p>“Gone to Liverpool in a snow out of Portland.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>The conversation was now interrupted by the
entrance of Fred. While the boys were greeting
and talking with him, Mrs. Rhines and the girls
embraced the opportunity to clear away the table;
and when this necessary duty was accomplished,
all drew up, and formed a happy circle.</p>

<p>“Here we are, all together again,” said John,
thrusting his chair between Charlie and Fred, and
taking a hand of each, while Tige, who could bear
“no rival near the throne,” put his nose in John’s
lap.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mrs. Rhines, “we have answered
all your questions, and told you all the news, we
should like to have you tell us some; and first,
why did you come afoot? You wrote us you was
coming by water. What has become of the boat,
Charlie?”</p>

<p>“Sold her to Mr. Foss. Just before we were
going to start, he offered me twenty-five dollars for
her. I asked John what he thought about it. He
said, sell her; ’twould be a great deal better fun to
come through the woods, and camp out; that sailing
was nothing new to us. So we put our
things aboard a coaster, took our packs, and
started.”</p>

<p>“And you had rather go through all that than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
come comfortably in the summer time, with a fair
wind, in a good boat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father; we had a first-rate time. I can
tell you they are going ahead in Portland, building
vessels at a great rate. Congress has granted
money to finish the light on Portland Head, and
it’s almost done.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got wagons and sleighs there,” said
Charlie. “They don’t ride altogether on horseback
as they do here. In one of these wagons a
farmer can carry a whole ox, or three or four
calves; carry a barrel of molasses, and two folks
ride besides; or eight or ten bushels of potatoes,
and whole firkins of butter. They don’t have to
carry a little, stuck in saddle-bags.”</p>

<p>“I should be afraid they would upset,” said
Mrs. Rhines.</p>

<p>“Father, they’ve got the biggest ox-wagons, that
haul monstrous loads of boards, and the wheels
have iron hoops on the rims. Our wheels are all
wood.”</p>

<p>“You can’t expect such things, John, in new
places. Portland is an old-settled place.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got a wagon with two horses, that
carries the mails and passengers to Portsmouth, to
meet the Boston stage. They’ve got chaises, lots
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
of them. All the ministers have them; and there’s
a man, just come there from Newburyport, that’s
going to make chaises.”</p>

<p>“Captain Rhines,” said Charlie, “there are big
Spanish and English ships come there after spars.”</p>

<p>“It must be a great place,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“I guess it is. Everybody that lives there says
it can’t help being a great place. They are expecting
it will be an awful big place; and there’s a
company getting up to build a wharf clear to the
channel,&mdash;O, I don’t dare to tell how long!&mdash;with
stores on it. They’re going to call it Union
Wharf.”</p>

<p>“Father,” said John, “a man came there lately
who wears loose breeches that come clear to his
shoes. They call ’em pantaloons. Captain Starrett
says it’s because he’s spindle-shanked, and
wants to cover his legs up.”</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon, Captain Rhines
put the saddle on the horse, and sent Elizabeth
over to Uncle Isaac’s; and when she returned,
both he and his wife came with her.</p>

<p>“Charlie,” said Captain Rhines, “in the morning
you and John must go and see old Mrs. Yelf.”</p>

<p>“O, sir, I can’t go anywhere or do anything till
I see father and mother.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>“You must see her, because the poor old lady
won’t live long, and she longs to see you. It
will take but a few minutes to go over in the
morning, and then John can set you on to the
island.”

<small>CHARLIE AT HOME AGAIN.</small></h2>

<p>The next morning, after making their call upon
Mrs. Yelf, greatly to the old lady’s satisfaction,
they started for Elm Island.</p>

<p>Ben and Sally, having been informed by Captain
Rhines of the time at which the boys would
start, and of the manner in which they expected
to come, were equally, with him, eagerly expecting
their arrival.</p>

<p>Many times she left her work during the day,
and went to the door to see if they were coming.
During the period that had elapsed since the brief
but glorious career of the West Wind, the old
dugouts had either passed into oblivion, or were
debased to mere tenders for the whaleboats, which
were kept afloat at their moorings, or even used as
cars (cages) to keep lobsters and clams alive in.
Whaleboats had also increased in numbers, by
reason of the impulse given to fishing, and were
frequently seen going to and fro in good weather;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
and Bennie, who took every sail, it mattered not
in what direction they were heading, for the Perseverance,
Jr., kept his mother in a constant state
of excitement by running into the house, and
bawling out, “Marm, they’re coming! They’re
most here!” Ben also frequently, in the course
of the day, swept the horizon with his spy-glass.
They expected the boys would land at Captain
Rhines’s first, stop all night, and then John come
over with Charlie. Accordingly he frequently inspected
the cove, and the adjacent shores, and if
he manifested less outward show of interest than
his father, it must be attributed to his sluggish
temperament, which was less easily roused, and
the fact that he had more to occupy him, and was
just at that time engaged with his hired man upon
a job that interested him exceedingly. He was at
work in his orchard.</p>

<p>When Ben declared that he would make cider
yet on Elm Island, it was no idle boast. He had
gone to work in the best possible way to accomplish
his designs. He had, in the first place,
burned the land over, the same season in which
the growth was cut, and before it was dry, on
purpose that the fire should not burn too deep,
and consume the vegetable mould down to a barren
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
subsoil. The growth of wood was also of a
kind that was rich in potash, an element in which
the apple, of all the trees of the field, delights.
Instead of waiting till he had taken several crops
from the land, the stumps had decayed, and it was
exhausted by many ploughings and plantings, he
set out three hundred grafted trees, of choice fruit,
that Mr. Welch had given him, right in the ashes,
and among the stumps. Wherever a stump interfered
with the regularity of the rows, he dug it
up, otherwise set the tree close beside it, and the
young tree fed upon its decaying roots. In addition
to this, the soil was filled with the excrements
of sea-fowl, that for centuries had bred upon the
island, and it was abundantly supplied with lime
from the shells of muscles, cockles, and bones of
fish with which they fed their young.</p>

<p>The orchard was upon a southern exposure,
sheltered by cliffs, forests, and rising ground from
cold and blighting winds, and the bowlders,
sprinkled here and there over the surface of the
land, were granite. Enjoying all these advantages
of soil and exposure, protected with jealous care
from the encroachments of cattle, the trees grew
more in one year than they would in one of our
old exhausted fields in four. Ben, excessively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
proud of them, stimulated their growth by every
means in his power, especially as he expected Mr.
Welch to make him another visit before long, and
wanted to show him what could be done on Elm
Island, as he had expressed some doubts if apple
trees would do anything so near the sea.</p>

<p>He was now engaged in burning the weeds and
brush, which had been previously cut and piled up,
intending to scatter the ashes around the roots
of the young trees. He was also removing the
stumps, a sharp drought proving very favorable to
his operations. There were a few pine stumps on
the piece, which, when not too near an apple tree,
were set on fire, and completely exterminated, the
fire following the roots into the dry soil, and living
there sometimes for weeks.</p>

<p>The greater proportion of the stumps were rock-maple,
beech, birch, and oak. The roots of these
had become a little tender, and by chopping off
some of the larger ones, could be upset and
wrenched from the soil with oxen, aided by a pry,
to which the great strength of Ben, supplemented
by that of Yelf, was applied. Setting cattle for a
severe pull, and making them do all they know
how, seems to consist in something more than
practice. It is a gift, and it was one that Ben
possessed in perfection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>When a lad, before he went to sea, he was considered
the best teamster in town, except Uncle
Isaac. It was the same with Charlie, who had
not been accustomed to cattle till he came to the
island, while John Rhines, who had all his life
been used to driving oxen, evinced neither inclination
nor capacity for it. As for Robert Yelf,
he couldn’t, to save his life, make four cattle pull
together, and always, when he got stuck, took
off the leading cattle. Those who do possess this
gift, like to exercise it: there is to them a strange
fascination in driving oxen, so dull and stupid a
business to others. It was thus with Ben; no
music was so sweet to him as the singing of the
links of a chain and the creaking of the bows in
the yoke as the cattle settled themselves for a
severe pull, their bellies almost touching the
ground. He had a noble team,&mdash;six oxen,&mdash;the
smallest ox in the team girthing seven feet three
inches, fat and willing. He had them so perfectly
trained, that after attaching them to the stump,
and placing them for a twitch, he and Yelf would
apply their strength to the pry, Ben would speak
to the oxen, rip, tear, snap would go the great
roots, out would come the stump, taking with it
earth, stones, and bushes, while Bennie would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
scream, “Get up, Star, you old villain!” pounding
on the ground with his stick, till he was red in
the face, the baby sitting in his little cart, would
crow, and Sailor bark in concert.</p>

<p>It is often that friends, for whom we have
been persistently watching, surprise us after all,
when we least expect them; it was so in the
present instance. Ben was so much occupied in
his work that day (and having been disappointed),
that after taking a look in the morning, he
had not again inspected the bay.</p>

<p>As for Sally, after having cooked up a lot of
niceties to welcome the boys, and running to the
door to look the greatest part of the time for
three or four days, she concluded that something
had delayed them at Portland, and there was no
telling when to look for them.</p>

<p>Since the stump-pulling had commenced, and
the fires been started, Bennie, having changed
his playground from the green before the front
door, which commanded a full view of the bay,
to the orchard, was busily employed roasting
clams by a fire made under a pine stump; Sailor
was helping him, the cat patiently waiting for
her share of the repast, the baby asleep in the
cradle, and Sally busy getting dinner. Aided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
by all these circumstances, the boys entered the
cove unperceived, and with all the caution of
whalemen approaching a slumbering whale.</p>

<p>“What a splendid wharf!” whispered Charlie
to John, as silently they crept along the footpath
to the house, expecting every moment to
hear an alarm. The hop-vine had covered half the
roof, and reached the chimney in one broad belt
of green, the honeysuckle hung in fragrant festoons
around the door and windows; Charlie
gave John a punch, and pointed to them, which
was answered by a nod.</p>

<p>The doors were all open, for it was a warm
day. Slipping off their shoes, they passed on
to the kitchen. Sally was frying fish in the Dutch
oven, and talking to herself all the while.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what has got those boys: they
ought to have been here a week ago. Here I,
and all of us, have been watching, and I have
been cooking, to have something nice for them
when they come. There are the custards, that
John likes so well, as sour as swill; the cake all
mouldy, and the chicken pie soon will be. Charlie
likes warm biscuit so well, I thought we should
see them when they got to the other shore, and
then I should have time to bake some, and have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
them piping hot when they get here; now I don’t
know what to do. There’s that mongrel goose, the
first one we have ever killed, Charlie thought so
much of them, and took so much pains to raise
them, I did mean he should help eat the first one.
O dear, I wish I hadn’t killed it; but now it’s
killed and cooked we must eat it, or it will spoil;
Charlie ain’t here, nor like to be.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is, you good old soul you.”</p>

<p>With a scream of delight Sally flung herself on
his neck.</p>

<p>“How you started me, you roguish boy, you and
John too. Why boys, where have you been?
We’ve been looking more than a week, with all the
eyes in our heads, and you’ve come at last, just
as we had given up.”</p>

<p>“What boat is that at the mooring, mother?”</p>

<p>“One your father built the year after you went
away.”</p>

<p>“I’m right glad, for I’ve sold mine in Portland,
and was afraid I shouldn’t have any to sail in.
Whose scow is that?”</p>

<p>“Ours; your father and Robert built it.”</p>

<p>“Where is father?”</p>

<p>“Out in the orchard, pulling up stumps.”</p>

<p>“Come, John, let’s go and surprise them.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>In this they were disappointed. Sailor espied
them, and gave the alarm.</p>

<p>“Why, how you’ve grown, you dear child!”
cried Charlie, catching Bennie up in his arms, who
came running to meet them.</p>

<p>“I should think somebody else had grown too,”
said Ben, taking them both up, setting Charlie
astride one of the near oxen’s back, with the child
in his arms; “but I believe John has grown the
most,” putting his arm around him, with an appearance
of great affection.</p>

<p>“What a noble team you’ve got, Ben; are these
the same cattle you had when we went away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all but them sparked ones on forward;
they are twins, and are seven feet and a half. I
went clear to North Yarmouth after them, and I
never have dared to tell how much I gave for
them. I’ve never asked them to do anything yet,
but what they’ve done it: that yoke ain’t fit for
them, it’s too narrow between the bow holes,
and hauls upon their necks. Charlie you must
make me one.”</p>

<p>“I will, father, I’ll make one that will fit them.
But how these apple trees have grown, I couldn’t
have believed it possible.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Charlie, what do you think now about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
making cider on Elm Island? In three years more
some of these largest apple trees will begin to bear,
and one of these in the garden, that Uncle Isaac
gave you, blossomed last spring.”</p>

<p>“Mother says dinner is ready.”</p>

<p>“How does the goose go, Charlie?” asked Sally,
when they were well entered upon the repast.</p>

<p>“Never tasted anything better in my life,” said
he, speaking with his mouth full.</p>

<p>“I must go now,” said John, when the meal was
ended; “I promised father I wouldn’t stop.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t go,” said Sally, “till after supper.
I baked some custards for you, and kept
them till they were sour. You can’t go till I bake
some more; so it’s no use to talk.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have supper early,” said Ben, “and you
can get home before dark.”</p>

<p>They spent the time till supper in social chat, and
in looking at the crops and improvements that had
been made on the island.</p>

<p>Charlie found the swallows had multiplied amazingly,
the eaves and rafters of the barn being
filled with long rows of nests.</p>

<p>“What a master slat of fowl” said both the
boys.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you ever killed any,” said
Charlie.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>“We haven’t many,” replied Ben; “we’ve been
saving them till you came.”</p>

<p>“Well Charlie,” said he, as they stood at the
shore looking after John, as he departed, “I suppose
Elm Island seems rather a dull place, and a
small affair, after being in such a great place as
Portland.”</p>

<p>“Portland!” cried Charlie, in high disdain, “I
wouldn’t give a gravel stone on this beach for
Portland, and all there is in it.”</p>

<p>“Nor I either. I suppose to-morrow you’ll want
to go over and see Joe and Uncle Isaac, and go to
Pleasant Cove.”</p>

<p>“Not till that orchard is done. I want to drive
those oxen. O, father, won’t we have a good time
burning the stumps, putting the ashes round the
trees, making it look neat and nice, and picking up
all the stones?”</p>

<p>“I see,” replied Ben, “you have brought back
the same heart you carried away.”</p>

<p>“Why, father, how could I go right off, when
you have got so much to do, and it is such a
nice time to do it? Besides, I haven’t seen the
maple, nor been up in the big pine; and I’ve
only just looked over the fowl, and haven’t taken
particular notice of any of them, nor of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
birds; then there’s a leg gone out of mother’s
wash-bench, a latch off the kitchen door, a square
of glass broke in the buttery, and that yoke to be
made, and the piece must be cut and put to season.
You must have a better goad, father; it’s a
shame to drive such a team with a beech limb.
There’s a tough little white-oak butt, as blue as a
whetstone, in the shop, that Uncle Isaac gave me:
I’ll make a goad of that. Then I mean to make a
pair of cart wheels, such as I saw in Portland,
on the Saccarappa teams, and John says he’ll put
tires on them. Why shouldn’t we have things on
Elm Island as well as they up there.”</p>

<p>“If you’re going to do all that, or half of it, you
wont get off the island this month.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I shall do it all now, but I’ll
begin, and I’ll make the goad before it’s time to
go to work to-morrow. Come, father, let us go
and split up the butt before dark.”</p>

<p>They took the small oak butt, set it on end,
Charlie held the axe to the end of it, Ben struck
the pole of the axe with a piece of wood, and they
split it in halves, saved one half for axe handles,
and split the other up fine for goads. Charlie was
up betimes in the morning, made a beautiful goad,
scraped it with glass, then rubbed it with dogfish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
skin, oiled it, and put a brad in it. It was tough as
leather. He made another for Bennie, Jr. Proudly
the little chap strutted beside Charlie with his
goad, kindled fires, heaped the brush and roots on
them, roasted clams, baked potatoes in an oven
Charlie made for him, and blessed his stars that
Charlie had come.</p>

<p>Before two days Charlie had cut down an elm,
roughed out a yoke, bored the bow-holes, and put
it up in the smoke-hole to season, to be smoothed
by and by. He counted sixteen partridges among
the yellow birches, but by Ben’s advice abstained
from killing any till they should have increased in
numbers.</p>

<p>“Let them alone, and give them a chance to lay
and breed another spring and summer,” said Ben,
“and then we can shoot as many as we want to eat,
and they will hold their own.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>JOE GRIFFIN AT HOUSEKEEPING.</small></h2>

<p>When Ben, Jr. received his goad, made as
smooth as glass and fish-skin could render it,
oiled with linseed oil to give it a handsome color
and make it more pliable, he was highly gratified.
The youngster, however, soon ascertained
that in one very important respect it was deficient:
there was no brad in it.</p>

<p>The discovery was by no means satisfactory;
a goad without a brad, was no goad at all, and
he teased Charlie till he put in one of considerable
length, as sharp as a needle, but told him
he must not stick it into the oxen. It unfortunately
happened that this was just the thing
Bennie wanted to do, and wanted the brad for.
Charlie stuck it into the oxen, and he flattered
himself that he could perform equally well. While
his father and Yelf were at the pry, he strutted
alongside of Charlie, leaping up and down
when it came to a severe pull, very red in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
face, smiting on the ground, and screaming, “Gee
Turk! back Buck! her Spark up, you old villain.”</p>

<p>For a while he amused himself by sticking
the brad into chips and flinging them to a distance,
or impaling wood-worms and grasshoppers;
but these amusements soon ceased to be exciting.
The little Mischief longed, but didn’t <i>quite dare</i>,
to try it on the oxen; he at length determined to do
or die. Watching his opportunity when Charlie’s
back was turned, he set his teeth, went close to
old Turk, shut both eyes, and jabbed the brad
into his thigh the whole length, with such good
will that the blood followed the steel. All around
the scene of labor were great stumps which had
been torn from the ground, some of the pines
ten or fifteen feet in circumference, sitting on
their edges, the sharp points of their roots protruding
in all directions. The enraged ox administered
a kick that sent Bennie through a
thorn bush, in amongst the jagged roots of a pine
stump, where he was wedged in fast, screaming
piteously. There was, indeed, abundant cause for
lamentation; the thorns had torn his hands and
the side of his face, the point of a pine root
had gone through his upper lip, and the skin
was scraped from his thigh.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding his fright and wounds, though
the blood was running from his lip and hands,
he resolutely refused to be carried to his mother
till he obtained his goad, thoroughly convinced
that it was a real one, and effectual, clung like birdlime
to the instrument of his misfortunes. The
next day being rainy, Charlie went to work in
the shop upon a pair of cart wheels, and during
the rest of the week continued to work on
them.</p>

<p>When Saturday evening came, Sally said to
him, “Now, Charlie, not another stroke of work
shall you do till you’ve been to see Uncle Isaac,
Joe Griffin, and the rest of your friends. Here
you’ve been away going on two years, and
come home for a visit, and stick right down to
work the very next day. It’s too bad. Uncle
Isaac will think you don’t care anything about
him. I should think you’d want to go to Pleasant
Cove.”</p>

<p>“So I do, mother; but you know father has
been alone a great part of the time, and I wanted
to help fix the orchard, get the stuff sawed
out for the wheels, and then I’m going to get
Uncle Isaac to help me make them.”</p>

<p>“Well, when we go over to meeting to-morrow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
I shall leave you, and you must stay till we
come over the next Lord’s day, and see all
hands.”</p>

<p>“I will, mother.”</p>

<p>John and Charlie went over to Uncle Isaac’s
and staid two days and nights. There they
learned that Isaac, his nephew, was expected
that week. From there they went to Joe Griffin’s.
His farm was situated on a ridge of excellent
land that rose gradually from the water, the summit
being covered with a mixed growth, in which
beech largely predominated, succeeded on the declivity
by rock maple, ash, and yellow birch. In
front of the house was a cove, with a point on
the south-west side, which sheltered it from winds
blowing from that direction, but was exposed to
the north and north-west winds. The house itself
stood within a stone’s throw of the shore,
in the middle of a clearing of about six acres.
It was a log house, of the rudest kind, as Joe
thought it very likely he might burn it up before
he got done setting fires. Rude as was its appearance,
the whole scene presented to the eye
an aspect of comfort and plenty. The burn had
a noble log fence around it; a magnificent piece
of corn completely surrounded the house and log
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
barn, growing to the very threshold, leaving only
a footpath by which to reach the house; on the
other side, the lot had been sown with wheat,
which was now cut, and large stooks were scattered
over the field.</p>

<p>As the boys approached, they paused in admiration.</p>

<p>“I have seen a good many pieces of corn
planted on a burn, but I never saw anything
that would begin with that.”</p>

<p>“Look at the grain,” said Charlie, “don’t that
look rich? Well, they’ll have enough to eat, that’s
certain.”</p>

<p>Entering the house, they found Mrs. Griffin
at the loom, weaving, and received a most cordial
welcome. The house had but two rooms,
but the roof being sharp, and the house large
on the ground, there was room to put beds in
the garret. Skeins of linen and woollen yarn,
hanging up all around the room, attested Sally’s
capabilities.</p>

<p>“Where is Joe?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“In the woods, on the back end of the lot,
falling trees. He goes into the woods as soon as
he can see, and stays as long as he can see.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>“He must make an awful hole in the woods
in a week,” said John.</p>

<p>“Have you got any pasture?”</p>

<p>“No; but the cow does first-rate on browse,
and what grass grows on open spots in the woods.
Now Joe gives her cornstalks, she does better
than our cows ever did at home in the best
pasture.”</p>

<p>“Have you got a pig?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes, a real nice one. Come, go look at him.
We’ve had milk enough for him till lately. Now
Joe has to buy potatoes for him; but we shall
have corn enough of our own by and by.”</p>

<p>“That you will,” said John. “I don’t see how
you get your cow into the barn. You can’t drive
her through this cornfield; it’s all around the barn.”</p>

<p>“We don’t. I go out in the woods to milk.
We’ve got a cow-yard there; and when it rains
Joe milks.”</p>

<p>“You have real nice times&mdash;don’t you, Sally?”</p>

<p>“I guess we do, John. We work hard, but we
are well and strong: work don’t hurt us, and
we’ve enough to eat. Our place is paid for.
There ain’t a man in the world has a right to ask
Joe for a dollar, and there never was a woman had
a <i>better</i> husband. We are just as happy as the
days are long.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>After seeing the pig and hens, the boys said
they must go and find Joe.</p>

<p>“Well, go right to the end of the corn, and
you’ll hear his axe. Do you like coot stew,
boys?”</p>

<p>“Don’t we!” said Charlie; “and haven’t had
one since we left home.”</p>

<p>“Then you shall have one for supper. Joe shot
some coots this morning.”</p>

<p>The boys proceeded through the woods, guided
by the sound of the axe, and soon perceived their
friend through the trees busily at work. Creeping
cautiously on their hands and knees, they succeeded
in approaching within a stone’s throw, and
concealing themselves behind the roots of an upturned
tree, observed his movements. For a long
distance in front of him were trees cut partly
through, the white chips covering the ground all
around their roots. He was now at work upon an
enormous red oak, with long, branching limbs.
Having finished his scarf on the side next to some
partially cut trees, and which had taken the tree
nearly off, he wiped the sweat from his brow, and
with an upward glance at the sun, leaned upon his
axe-handle.</p>

<p>It was evident to the boys that Joe had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
chopping trees partly off during the whole afternoon,
and was about to fall the monster oak on
them, in order to make a drive; and as he knew by
the sun it was not far from supper-time, this was
the last he intended to cut before supper. He had
evidently done a hard day’s work. The sweat was
dropping from his nose, and his clothes were
saturated. Nevertheless, a smile passed over his
features, as he stood with a foot on one of the
great spur roots of his victim, leaning forward
upon the axe-handle, evidently in a very happy
frame of mind.</p>

<p>“He’s thinking about that piece of corn,” whispered
Charlie, “and what a nice farm he’ll have
when he gets these trees out of the way.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see him looking at the sun? He’s
glad it’s most supper-time, when he can see
Sally.”</p>

<p>Joe now resumed his work, and taking hold of
the end of his axe-handle with both hands, delivered
long, swinging blows, with the precision and
rapidity of some engine, while the great chips fell
from the scarf, and accumulated in a pile around
the roots.</p>

<p>“I told you he wanted to see Sally. Only see
that axe go in! How true he strikes, and what a
long-winded creature he is!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>“Won’t that make a smashing when it falls?
Such a big tree, and such long limbs! There it
goes! I can see the top quiver!”</p>

<p>Crack! snap! Joe ceased to strike as the
enormous bulk tottered for a moment in the air,
then falling upon the trees adjoining, which were
cut nearly off, bore them down in an instant, these
in their turn falling upon others. Beneath this
tremendous aggregate of forces, the forest fell with
a roar and crash, as though uprooted by a whirlwind,
the air was filled with branches and leaves,
and when the tumult had subsided, a long, broad
path was cut through the dense forest, with here
and there a mutilated stub standing upright amid
the desolation. As the last tree touched the
earth, a loud cheer, mingled with the sound of
cracking timber and rending branches. Turning
suddenly around, Joe confronted John and
Charlie.</p>

<p>“How are you, old slayer of trees?” cried
Charlie.</p>

<p>“First-rate, my little boat-builder,” replied Joe,
taking both his hands; “and how are you,
John?”</p>

<p>“Well and hearty.”</p>

<p>“I’m right glad to see you, boys, and take it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
real kind in you to come clear up here to visit me.
When did you get home?”</p>

<p>“Last week,” said Charlie. “We came over to
Uncle Isaac’s, and from there here. You’ve got a
real nice place, Joe. How much land have you?”</p>

<p>“Two hundred acres. It is well watered and
timbered. There’s pine on the back part, as there
is on your’n, and all these lots. Did you see my
corn?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve been to the house, and came right
through it. I never saw such corn before!” said
John.</p>

<p>“That’s what everybody says, and the wheat is
as good as the corn. If the frost holds off, and the
bears don’t eat it up, I shall have a lot of corn;
but right here in the woods the frost is apt to
strike early.”</p>

<p>“Been cutting up any shines lately, Joe?”
asked John.</p>

<p>“Not a shine. I’m an old, steady, married
man.”</p>

<p>The horn was now heard.</p>

<p>“Come, boys, there’s supper.”</p>

<p>It was only five o’clock. It was the farmers’
custom in those days to have supper at five or half
past, and then work till night. Sally had provided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
a bountiful supper&mdash;a coot stew, flapjacks, with
maple sirup and custards.</p>

<p>“Did you make this sirup, Joe?” asked
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes, or rather, Sally did, and sugar enough to
last a year. I tapped the trees, and fixed a kettle
in the woods, and she made it while I was clearing
land long before the house was built. She said if
I was going to have corn to begin with, she would
have sugar, and you see she’s got it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>HOW JOE ENTERTAINED HIS GUESTS.</small></h2>

<p>After supper the boys prepared to take leave.</p>

<p>“Go!” cried Joe; “you ain’t a going to do any
such thing. You’re going to stay a week. What
did you come for&mdash;just to aggravate a fellow?
It is like showing a horse an ear of corn out of the
garret window.”</p>

<p>“But we want to go and see Flour, and Fred,
and lots of folks,” said John.</p>

<p>“Flour’s over to Wiscasset: besides, you mustn’t
call him Flour; he’s Peterson, now.”</p>

<p>“But you want to be clearing land, and we shall
only hinder you.”</p>

<p>“I tell you you <i>can’t</i>, nor <i>shan’t</i> go; so say no
more about it. I want you to help me make a
bear-trap to-night, and shoot some pigeons in the
morning on the stubble.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m sure I shan’t stir a step,” cried
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Nor I, either,” said John.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p>“I thought I should bring you to your senses.
Have you seen the pig?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s a beauty!”</p>

<p>“Well, you haven’t seen the garden.”</p>

<p>“A garden on a burn! Who ever heard of such
a thing?” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“You don’t know everything, if you have been
to Portland, and worked in a ship-yard. Come
‘long o’ me.”</p>

<p>He led them to the south side of the log barn,
and there they beheld a sight that astonished them
not a little. Right among the stumps were growing,
in the greatest imaginable luxuriance, beans,
peas (second crop), squashes, cucumbers, potatoes,
cabbages, watermelons, and flat-turnips. The peas
and squash-vines had completely covered the
stumps, and large squashes were hanging from
them, and lying between the great forked roots
of the trees in all directions.</p>

<p>“Didn’t take many sticks for the peas,” said Joe,
“stumps are so thick. What do you think of that
for a cowcumber?” pointing to a very large one.
“Just see the watermillions!” taking up one as
large as a large pumpkin. “All this kind of truck
grows first-rate on a burn&mdash;squashes, turnips,
peas, and especially watermillions. But come, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
we are going to set that bear-trap, it’s time we
were at it.”</p>

<p>When they arrived at the place Joe had selected,
he cut a large log, three feet in diameter and about
fifteen feet long, rolled another of the same length
and size on top of it, then set two large stakes at
each end where the two logs were to touch each
other, driving them down with his axe. These
were to keep the top log from rolling off the under
one. They now lifted the top log up. It was as
much as the three could lift, and John held it with
a handspike, while Joe and Charlie set the trap,
which was done in this manner: A round stick
was laid across the bottom log, and a sharpened
stake set under the upper one, the end of it resting
on this round stick, and the bait fastened to the
round stick. The moment the bear pulled the bait
towards him, it caused the round stick to roll, and
down came the great log on his head.</p>

<p>“I could have set it more ticklish,” said Joe,
“but I was afraid the wind would spring it; and
these plaguy coons, that eat whatever a bear eats,
will do it.”</p>

<p>It is evident, that as the trap is now arranged,
the bear might approach on the side, pull the bait
out, and spring the trap without being caught.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
In order to prevent this, a row of strong stakes
is set in the ground on the side where the bait
is, forming a pen enclosing the bait placed upon
the end of the round stick, which projects into the
pen; thus the bear, in order to reach the bait,
must crawl between and across the logs, and by
pulling the bait, brings down the top log upon him.</p>

<p>“Charlie, I’ve forgot the bait,” said Joe. “Run
up to the house, and ask Sally to give you the
quarter of lamb Uncle Isaac gave me. Don’t you
think the wolves killed ten sheep last night for
him and the Pettigrews!”</p>

<p>“How did they get at them?”</p>

<p>“There hadn’t been any wolves round for some
time, and they left them out of the fold. Uncle
Isaac sent the meat of one to me.”</p>

<p>It may be well to inform our readers that in
those days sheep were folded every night, to protect
them from the wolves. A log pen was built
on a piece of land where some one of the neighbors
intended to plant corn the next year, and a
number of flocks of sheep were driven in every
night. After a while the pen was moved to another
spot, and the land was thus thoroughly
enriched.</p>

<p>The next year, the sheep were folded upon another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
person’s land. Sometimes, as in the present
instance, through neglect, or not being able to find
them, they were left out, and fell a prey to the
wolves, who not only killed what sheep they
wanted to eat, but would bite the throats and
suck the blood of all they could get at.</p>

<p>When Charlie came with the meat, Joe fastened
it to the round stick, taking several turns with the
rope around the stick, in order that it might roll
when the bear pulled the meat towards him.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Joe, “all that’s wanting is the bear,
and there’s just time enough before dark to set a
spring-gun. Did you know I’ve got Ben’s big gun
over here?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I have. He said I might have it a while if I
would make a handsome stock to it. It’s just the
thing for bears. Come, go with me and get it,
right in my shop. You haven’t seen my work-shop
yet.”</p>

<p>“Have you got a work-shop?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I have. Not quite so nice as yours
on the island, but it answers the purpose very well.”</p>

<p>Joe led the way to the house. On the side of
it he had built a lean-to of logs, quite large, and in
it a stone fireplace, with a chimney of sticks of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
wood, filled in with clay; but he had an excellent
set of tools, of the kind used in that day, and a
bench. Here Joe worked for others, not for himself,
and made yokes, harrows, ploughs, and other
utensils for his neighbors, who did not possess the
tools, or the gift to use them, and received his pay
in labor or provisions, and a little money.</p>

<p>In his proceedings was realized the proverb,
“The shoemaker’s wife and the blacksmith’s mare
always go bare;” for while he made all kinds of
conveniences for others, he had none for himself,
but intended to have them all by and by, when
the land was cleared, the place stocked, and he
built a frame house.</p>

<p>“Look here, Charlie,” said Joe, showing him a
piece of wild cherry-tree wood, in which the veins
were very much diversified, “won’t that be handsome
when it is worked off and polished? I mean
to make a stock of that for the old gun, that will
come to a fellow’s face like a duck’s bill in the
mud; but the old one is just as good for me to
knock round in the dirt, and set for bears.”</p>

<p>Joe threw the gun on his shoulder, and they
started for the cornfield. He had planted the corn
somewhat regularly in rows, though they were
often broken by stumps.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>He showed the boys a gap in the fence, where a
bear had come in a few nights before.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you stop it up?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“What would be the use of that? You can’t
fence against a bear. You might as well fence
against a cat. Besides, when a bear has come into
a field once, he will most always take the same
road next time, and I’m going to plant my battery
on that calculation.”</p>

<p>It so happened that the gap in the fence through
which the bear had made his entrance on previous
nights ranged between two rows of corn. In the
centre, between these rows, Joe drove two stout
stakes into the ground, and splitting their ends
with the axe, forced the gun, heavily loaded with
ball and shot, into the splits, the muzzle directed
towards the gap in the fence. At the breech of
the gun, near to, and a little behind the trigger, he
placed a crotch, in which he laid a stick, one end
of it resting in the ground before the trigger, to
the other end he fastened a stout cod-line, thus
forming a lever purchase. This line was conducted
by crotches driven into the ground directly in
front of the gun, then ran across the row back
again, and was fastened to the stake which supported
the muzzle of the gun. If the bear trod
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
upon or leaned against this line, he would discharge
the piece, shoot himself, and thus his blood
be upon his own head. If he came through the
gap, or along between the rows, he could not well
help stepping on the line.</p>

<p>“There ain’t much likelihood of shooting a bear
with a spring-gun,” said Joe, when he had made
his preparations. “They have got to come right
before it. If he don’t come through this gap to-morrow
night, I’ll put some bait before the gun to
tole him.”</p>

<p>They now returned to the house.</p>

<p>“It must be nice to have bears!” said Charlie.
“What a good time I might have if I was on my
place, making traps, setting guns, and hunting!”</p>

<p>“It ain’t so very nice,” said Joe, “to work hard,
and raise a piece of corn, then just as it is in the
milk, and growing as fast as it can, have a whole
army of bears and coons waiting to destroy it the
moment you shut your eyes.”</p>

<p>The boys, when they retired, thought they
should certainly hear the gun if it went off in
the night; but instead of this, they slept so soundly
they did not wake till Joe called at sunrise.</p>

<p>“Has the gun gone off?” cried Charlie, almost
before his eyes were open.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>“Don’t know. Didn’t hear it. Didn’t calculate
to.”</p>

<p>“Is there any bear in the trap?” cried John.</p>

<p>“Haven’t been to see.”</p>

<p>The boys were quickly dressed, and all three
were on their way to the cornfield.</p>

<p>“It’s sprung! Hurrah! The trap’s sprung!”
shouted Charlie, standing on tiptoe, and looking
ahead.</p>

<p>The boys broke into a run, leaving Joe, more
cool and probably less sanguine, to follow at his
leisure. When at length he reached the spot, he
found them standing with blank faces before the
trap, in which was the head and shoulders of a
coon, the remaining portion of the body having
been eaten off.</p>

<p>“You mean, miserable little rat you!” exclaimed
Charlie. “Nobody wanted you. What business
had you to get into a bear-trap?”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose eat the coon?” asked
John. “Foxes?”</p>

<p>“Foxes? no,” replied Joe. “A bear. Look at
that corn,” pointing to a place where the bear,
after eating the corn, had broken down the stalks,
eaten some ears, bitten others, and apparently lain
down and wallowed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>“Look there,” said Charlie, taking up a stalk
of corn that was bloody; “that was the first
one he bit, and some of the coon’s blood is
on it.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t done much hurt,” said Joe; “didn’t
get in till most morning, or he would have done
more; he’ll be sure to come back again, as he
got part of a bellyful, and didn’t get enough.”</p>

<p>They now went to the place where they had
set the gun.</p>

<p>“It’s gone,” screamed the boys, who had gone
ahead; “there’s no gun here.”</p>

<p>When Joe came to the place, he found the
gun gone, the stakes that had held it upset, the
crotches torn from the ground, and the cod-line
wound around the hills of corn, which was trampled
down in all directions.</p>

<p>“Here’s the gun,” cried John; “it’s gone off.”</p>

<p>“Here’s blood,” said Charlie, who had gone to
the gap in the fence; “here’s blood all over this
log, where he bled getting over.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said John, holding up the gun;
“only look at the stock.”</p>

<p>“That’s where he bit it,” said Joe; “he was
mad, and so he bit the thing that hurt him.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>“I don’t blame him,” said Charlie, “if he got
all that buck shot and those balls in him.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s hurt bad; he’s got some of ’em
in him.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go right after him this minute: we’ll
have him.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, my boy; we’ll have some breakfast
first; we may have to follow him miles.”</p>

<p>Breakfast was soon despatched. Joe loaded up
the big gun, gave John his own rifle, and Charlie
an old Queen’s arm that belonged to Henry.</p>

<p>“There’s been two of ’em in the corn, I know
as well as I want to,” said Joe. They were
able to track him by the blood and a peculiar
mark like a scratch on the leaves, and wherever
the ground was soft.</p>

<p>“He must have one leg broke or hurt,” said
Joe: “see there! every little while he drags it.”</p>

<p>Thus they followed for hours, sometimes losing
the track, and then, after a long search, finding
it again, which consumed a great deal of
time. The trail led them in the direction of
Charlie’s place.</p>

<p>“It’s one of your bears, Charlie; they are
breachy. I wish you would keep them at home
out of my corn.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>“You must put them in pound, Joe.”</p>

<p>Pursuing till they came to the brook, they
lost the track altogether. Thinking he might
have gone into the brook, they followed along
the banks on each side to the pond, hoping to
regain his track when he left the water, but
without success. They were now hungry and
discouraged,&mdash;it was the middle of the afternoon,&mdash;and
were about to abandon the search and return,
but sat down under a short, butted, scrubby
hemlock to rest and consult.</p>

<p>“If we only had Tige,” said John, “he would
take us right to him.”</p>

<p>For the last hour they had seen no blood, and
Joe reckoned that the blood had clotted in the
wounds, or he had stuffed them with moss.</p>

<p>“We shall have to give him up; he’s got into
his den,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t we go home and get Tige
on the track, and start, early in the morning?”</p>

<p>While they were conversing, a drop of blood
fell on the back of Charlie’s hand. Looking up,
he saw the bear in the tree right over his head.</p>

<p>Worn out with fatigue and loss of blood, and
unable to reach his den, with the last efforts
of remaining strength he had crawled up the tree,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
with the design of ascending to the thick top,
and escaping the notice of his pursuers; but having
tangled the cod-line, to which the stake
which supported the muzzle of the gun was attached,
round one of his hind legs, he had
dragged it after him, and catching it in the
lower limbs, he, being exhausted, was brought
to an anchor. The exertion of climbing the tree
had made the wound bleed afresh.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, friend,” said Joe, who was
greatly elated at this unlooked-for success; “see
what you did,”&mdash;holding up the long gun, and
showing the bear the marks of his own teeth
on the stock. “Who do you think is to pay
for that, eh? Don’t you wish you’d kept out
of my corn?”</p>

<p>“See how guilty he looks,” said John, pointing
to the creature, who lay with his fore paws
on a large branch, gravely regarding his foes
with the stoicism of an Indian at the stake.</p>

<p>“Come, boys, which of you want to shoot
him?”</p>

<p>They both were silent.</p>

<p>“John does,” said Charlie, at length.</p>

<p>“Charlie does,” replied John.</p>

<p>“Both of you do. Well, both of you fire at
him.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_101" src="images/i-101.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Last of the Bear.</span>&mdash;Page 101.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p></div>

<p>Scarcely were the words uttered when their guns
made a common report, and the bear tumbled to
the ground perfectly dead.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you glad you didn’t go home yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Guess we are.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t a bit hungry, nor tired, now?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p>“It’s nearer five o’clock than four, and that bear
must be got home and dressed to-night. I thought
his leg was broken, but it was that stake dragging
that made the trail, and helped greatly to tire
him.”</p>

<p>Joe tied his legs together with the cod-line, and
finding a dead spruce, they broke it down, and
thrust it between his legs; Joe taking one end
on his shoulders and the boys the other, they carried
the carcass to the shore.</p>

<p>“This is a big one,” said Joe, drawing a long
breath: “he weighs every bit of three hundred. Well,
I’ve kept him well; he’s had all the corn he’s wanted,
and the best of corn too; and there’s been any
quantity of blueberries this year. Now let us take
a drink at Cross-root Spring, leave our guns here,
go home and get supper, then take the boat, come
up and get the bear.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>“We are going to call it Quicksilver Spring
now,” said Charlie: “you know what happened
here.”</p>

<p>“Well, Quicksilver Spring, then.”</p>

<p>“It was a noble day’s work Uncle Isaac did
that day.”</p>

<p>“He saved that young man; but we are not
a going to have to fight the battle, a handful of
us, with liquor much longer.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because people that have got larning, and that
are looked up to, are beginning to take it up.
James Welch sent a newspaper to Uncle Isaac that
has printed what Dr. Franklin said about it long
ago; and there’s a long piece that the College
of Doctors in Philadelphia sent to Congress, about
it, saying something ought to be done; that rum
was ruining the country, and upsetting all we had
done in getting our liberty: the paper’s at the
house; you can read it. Now, when the papers
take anything up, it’s a sartain sign that there are
a good many people thinking about those matters,
and want to hear about them; they never
bark till the deer’s afoot; it will spread just like
ile when you drop it on the water to spear a
flounder.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>Thus beguiling the rough journey through the
forest, they arrived home just before sundown.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, while Sally’s putting supper on the
table, we’ll just set the trap again.”</p>

<p>After resting a while, and eating a substantial
meal, having eaten nothing since six o’clock that
morning, they took the boat, and being favored
with a fair wind and tide, sailed leisurely up the
bay under a bright starlight.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the night before us,” said Joe, “so
needn’t hurry.”</p>

<p>“This is easier than walking,” said Charlie; “the
tide will turn by the time we get there, and if
we do have to beat or row back, we shall have
a fair tide.”</p>

<p>They were favored in this respect; for by the
time they had placed the bear in the boat, and
were ready to start, it fell calm, and they rowed
leisurely home with the tide.</p>

<p>It was much nearer morning than midnight,
when, having dressed the animal and hung him
up in the barn floor, they went to bed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>TRAPPING AND NETTING.</small></h2>

<p>It was eight o’clock when the boys got up the
next morning. Joe was stretching the skin on the
barn door, and his wife frying bear’s steaks for breakfast.
They had eaten but two meals the day before,
and though the last was a very hearty one,
yet, as they had been at work out of door, the
greater part of the night, they awoke hungry.
The smell of the meat was so savory, and it looked
so tempting, as Sally piled up the large slices on
the plate, and prepared to place them on the table,
that, resisting the impulse to go out of doors, the
boys sat down to await breakfast, which they saw
was nearly ready.</p>

<p>“Where is Joe?” inquired John.</p>

<p>“Stretching the bear’s skin.”</p>

<p>“Has he been to the trap?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Charlie shoved back the sliding shutter of the
window that commanded a view of the barn (there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
was but one glazed window in the house; the others
were furnished with wooden shutters, in two of
which there were diamond-shaped holes cut, and
small squares of glass set in them), where Joe was
at work.</p>

<p>“Joe!”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“Joe!”</p>

<p>Joe kept on driving the nails into the edges of
the hide.</p>

<p>“Jo-o-o-o!”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>“Have you been to the bear-trap?”</p>

<p>“Been <i>where</i>?”</p>

<p>“Why, to the trap, to see if it was sprung.”</p>

<p>“How could I go, when I had this hide to take
care of?”</p>

<p>“Will you say you haven’t?”</p>

<p>“Guess not.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything in it?” cried Charlie, stirred
up by the evasive answers he received.</p>

<p>“How you do like to ask questions!”</p>

<p>“A bear! a bear!” roared Charlie, jumping out
of the window and running full speed for the trap,
with John at his heels. When they arrived at
the spot, the trap was sprung, sure enough, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
in it was a bear of the largest size, with his body
across the lower log, the upper on his back, and his
hinder parts on the ground.</p>

<p>“Ain’t he a big one!” said John: “see what handsome
fur; a real jet black,”&mdash;passing his hand along
his back; “they are not all so black; some of ’em
are kind of brown and faded out.”</p>

<p>“See what claws!” said Charlie, taking up one
of his fore paws and spreading apart the toes with
his fingers.</p>

<p>“They are awful strong,” said John: “Uncle Isaac
says they will stave the head of a barrel of molasses
in with blows of their paws, and that he
has seen ’em, when hunting after bugs and wood-worms
in old rotten logs, strike with their paws,
and split them right open.”</p>

<p>The horn now sounded for breakfast.</p>

<p>“How much is that bear-skin worth, Joe?”
asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“About six dollars; perhaps more.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll get some pay for your corn.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and then the meat is good.”</p>

<p>“And the fat is first rate to have in the house;
it’s as good as lard,” said Sally.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is,” said Joe, “we have it all at
once; now we’ve got the meat of two bears, and it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
will spoil before we can eat half of it; then there are
sea-fowl, lobsters, and pigeons, so that everything
comes together. We ought to give some of this
meat to the neighbors: bears ain’t so plenty
down to the village as they are up here in the
woods.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go over to Uncle Isaac’s,” said Sally, “and
tell him he can send word to some of the neighbors,
and to your father’s folks, to come and get
some.”</p>

<p>“When the boys go home I will take them
down to Captain Rhines’s in the boat, and carry
some meat to him and Ben.”</p>

<p>“We’ll help you dress the bear, Joe, and then
we must go,” said Charlie: “we can’t stay any
longer; we should like to; we’ve had the greatest
time that ever was, but we must go now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to hear any such talk as that; it’s
no kind of use to talk that way here; can’t spare
you; we’ve got just as much to do to-day as we can
spring to, then fix the pigeon-bed, set the net, make
a cage to put them in, dress this bear, and set the
dead-fall for another.”</p>

<p>“A pigeon-net? What is that?”</p>

<p>“Why, Charlie,” said John, “don’t you know
what a pigeon-net is?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>“No. I thought they shot ’em.”</p>

<p>“How should he know?” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Why, Charlie, they catch them by hundreds in
nets.”</p>

<p>“Do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and put them in a cage.”</p>

<p>“And put them in a cage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they put them in a cage, or some place,
and keep them, and fat them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t the net kill ’em?”</p>

<p>“No. Don’t hurt ’em one mite.”</p>

<p>“Then I shan’t go, if all that’s going on.”</p>

<p>No sooner was breakfast over, and the bear
dressed, than Joe brought out his net. It was fifteen
feet in length by ten in width.</p>

<p>“Who made this net?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Sally: she spun all the twine on the flax wheel,
and netted it.”</p>

<p>Taking the net, they went on to the wheat stubble.
Near the woods was a place where there had
been an opening when the land was in forest; consequently,
when the fire had burned off the moss
and leaves (duff, as Joe called it), the ground was
mellow and free from roots. A portion of this he
had dug up, carried away all the sticks and stones,
raked it as smooth as a garden bed, and flung
wheat on it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>Early in the morning and towards night the
wild pigeons would come, light on the trees, look
at the grain a while, then fly down and eat. He
had baited the pigeons thus for several days, till
they had become used to the spot, and quite tame:
now he prepared to net them.</p>

<p>In the first place, they set down, at each corner
of the bed (which was a little larger than the net),
pieces of plank with their edges directed across the
bed, about a foot above the surface of the ground:
in the sides of two of them cut slots, on the inside
of one and the outside of the other, that is, the
corner ones; on the longest side, at the distance of
about twelve feet from the planks and on the opposite
side from the posts in which the slots are
cut, they put down, three feet into the ground, and
on a line with them, two tough green beech saplings,
three inches through at the butt, and six feet
in height. To the top of these posts he fastened a
strong rope forty feet long, and the edge of the net
to this rope. The lower edge of the net was fastened
to the ground by little crotches, on the opposite
side from the high posts, and merely slack
enough left of the rope to admit of taking the net
and rope across, and permitting the net to lie
nicely folded in as compact a form as possible on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the ground along the edge of the bed. He then
took two strips of stiff, hard wood board, an inch
and a quarter thick and two inches wide, with a
dove-tail notch in one end to hold the rope; one
end of these he set against the plank posts, which
were well over towards the middle of the bed on the
side the log posts stood, put the notched end against
the bight of the rope to which the net was fastened,
and, pressing down with all his might, sprung the
stiff beech posts enough to force the sticks (flyers
he called them), with the rope attached to them,
into the slots in the plank posts. The net, which lay
nicely folded along the edge of the bed, was then
covered over with earth; long limbs, thickly covered
with leaves, were now cut and set up, forming
a booth around one of the high posts at one
end, bringing the line to which the flyers were fastened
into the booth, thus enabling the hunter
concealed there, at one twitch, to pull the flyers,
which held the net down, out of the slots, when
the tremendous spring of the beech poles would
fling the net over the bed in an instant.</p>

<p>Wheat was now strown in a long row the whole
length of the bed, and nearest to the side on which
the net was folded, that the pigeons, when they
came on, might be sure to be completely enveloped,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
being nearer the centre of the net. Some
saplings were set in hollow stumps and in the
ground to form lighting places, as pigeons like to
have a chance to reconnoitre before flying down.</p>

<p>Joe had not intended to set the net so soon, but
to have built the booth, set up the poles, and put
on the rope, in order that the pigeons might get
accustomed to the sight of these objects; but he
had hurried up matters to keep the boys there and
gratify them.</p>

<p>“We won’t spring it to-night, boys, but let them
come here, get their supper, and see all these
fixings. They will come and light on the trees,
look round, see the grain; some of them will come
to the bed, eat a little, and make up their minds
that all is right. To-night we’ll put on fresh grain,
and in the morning make a real haul.”</p>

<p>The forenoon was fully occupied with the bear
and the pigeon-bed. In the afternoon they went to
work to make a cage to keep them. They made
it of logs, covering the top with small poles, that
they might have plenty of light and air, put in
roosts, and made a trough for water.</p>

<p>The cage, instead of being square, was made in
the shape of a blunt wedge, and the apex lined
with a net, so that they could be driven into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
narrow part into the net, and caught without difficulty.</p>

<p>At night they visited the bed, found the pigeons
had been there, and having put on fresh grain,
went home, and, being weary from the work of
the previous night, retired early, with sanguine
expectations for the morrow.</p>

<p>Joe called them before the dawn of day, and
they were all three soon secreted in the booth.
As the day broke, they began to hear a flapping
of wings. First came three or four, then more,
till long before sunrise the saplings, trees in the
woods, and even the rope that ran from the spring-pole
to the ground, were all covered with them.</p>

<p>Charlie was quivering with excitement. He had
never seen anything like it in his life, and could
scarcely contain himself as he watched them
through the network of branches. There they
sat, arching their necks, turning their heads first
to one side and then to the other. At length one
flew down to the grain, instantly followed by
others; and then the whole flock came down,
crowding together, and eating with the utmost
voracity. As they were coming to the place,
Charlie had entreated Joe to let him spring the
net, and now stood with his hand on the rope;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
but when the crisis came, he felt that there was
too much at stake, and made a sign to Joe. He
gave a sudden jerk; whiz! went the rope. The
fliers were flung twenty feet in the air, the whole
front of the booth fell over, flung off by the rope,
and such a fluttering of wings you never heard!</p>

<p>“O, my soul!” exclaimed Charlie. “There,
there, I’ve lived long enough! Only see the&mdash;see
the necks!”</p>

<p>“There’s forty dozen if there’s one,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“That’s what I call a haul,” said John.</p>

<p>“But,” said Charlie, “only see how pert they
look, and happy, too! I thought it was going to
hurt or kill some of them.”</p>

<p>When the net goes over the pigeons, they will
stick up their necks through the meshes. It was
this sight, so singular to one unaccustomed to it,
that excited the wonder and prompted the exclamation
of Charlie.</p>

<p>“I have made up my mind to one thing,” he
continued. “I <i>will not</i> go back to Portland if I
can get my living here.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, either,” said John.</p>

<p>“Glad you’ve both got so much sense. What
ails you to get your living? I’ll give both of you
your board and clothes to come and work for me.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>“Much obliged, but we want to do a little more
than that.”</p>

<p>“Well, haven’t you got a good farm, all paid for,
or something to make one of? Ain’t you a boat-builder?
Ain’t John a blacksmith?”</p>

<p>“If anybody was living here,” said John, “they
could put in and do a lot of work, then go off and
hunt, have a grand time, get straightened out, the
kinks taken out of them, and then come back and
work all the better.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Charlie; “and it pays to net
pigeons, kill bears and coons, and get the flesh to
eat; also sea-fowl, seals, and deer, and have the
feathers and skins to sell. But in Portland, if
you’re out of work, all you can do is to sit on the
anvil, or stand in the sun, leaning against an upright
in the ship-yard, chewing chips, making up
sour faces, and saying, ‘O, I wish somebody would
give me a job! some farmer lose his axe and want
another, or some ship would get cast away, so I
could build one.’ I tell you, I won’t go back.
The more I think of it, the more I don’t
want to.”</p>

<p>“On the strength of that,” said Joe, “kill half a
dozen of these pigeons, and we’ll go home and get
some baskets to take the rest to the cage.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>Our readers know that Charlie was exceedingly
fond, not only of the soil, but of trees and plants
of all kinds. Born and reared in early life in a
land where trees are comparatively rare, and
prized accordingly, he was not at all pleased
with the wholesale destruction Joe had made
with axe and firebrand. Joe, on the other hand,
possessed the true spirit of a pioneer, and had been
educated to consider trees as natural enemies, and
that a person’s pluck was to be measured by the
number he could destroy.</p>

<p>“Joe,” said Charlie, “why didn’t you save some
of those splendid great maples, ash, and birches to
shade your homestead?”</p>

<p>“<i>Save</i> ’em! I’ve had trouble enough to get rid
of ’em. I’d rather have corn and wheat.”</p>

<p>“But after you get all this land into grass, and a
frame house built, then you’ll wish you had, and
go to setting them out; and by the time they’re
grown you’ll be an old man. Don’t you think
the trees around our brook, and before Captain
Rhines’s house, look handsome?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his wife, “I’m sure I do; they look
beautiful. There’s one tree I don’t believe Captain
Rhines would sell for a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“You can’t save ’em. You got to put the fire in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
to clear your lands, and do it when it’s dry, or you
can’t get a good burn; and if you leave any trees,
the fire will roast the roots and kill ’em. Those
trees of Captain Rhines’s wasn’t <i>saved</i>. His father
set them out, and I’ve heard Uncle Isaac say people
thought he was in his dotage for doing it.”</p>

<p>“They don’t think so now. I don’t see why
you can’t pull the brush and other trees away from
their roots.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, you can’t; for in a dry time the old
leaves, moss, and the whole top of the ground will
burn, or at any rate be hot enough to scald and
kill the roots.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you ever tried very hard to save
a tree, Joe.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I saw Seth Warren try to save
some sugar maples, and he couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, if ever I build a house on my place, I’ll
save some, and a good many, too; see if I don’t.”</p>

<p>“We shall see. When is that happy time
coming?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but hope it will be before you
kill all the bears.”</p>

<p>“You and I ain’t much alike. You want to
save all the bears and trees, and I want to use
up both.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>“Joe, there’s one thing I wish you’d do for me.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“If you ever come across a little cub, save it for
me, or a pair if you can.”</p>

<p>“You going to stock Elm Island with bears?”</p>

<p>“I would if I could. Joe, what’s the reason
pigeons don’t come to Elm Island? Only once
in a while half a dozen light as they go over.”</p>

<p>“’Cause there’s nothing for them to eat there.
They live on what bears do&mdash;acorns, beech-nuts,
and blueberries; but on your place there’s enough
for both. Come, hurry up your cakes, and get on
to it, and we’ll hunt in company.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon Joe carried the boys down to
Captain Rhines’s in the boat, with pigeons and
bear’s meat enough for his family and Ben’s.
After meeting Sunday, Charlie returned to the
island.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS.</small></h2>

<p>One would naturally suppose that Charlie, returning
to the quiet of Elm Island after the exciting
week he had passed, would have experienced
at least a transient feeling of loneliness; but he
manifested no such sentiment, and went to work
at his cart-wheels with the greatest assiduity and
evident enjoyment.</p>

<p>In the course of the week he was most agreeably
surprised by a visit from John and Fred, bringing
Isaac Murch, Jr., with them, now a tall, strong
young man, swarthy from long exposure to the
East India suns and sea-winds, bearing a very
strong resemblance to his uncle, with intelligence
and energy in every feature.</p>

<p>It was past the middle of the afternoon when
the boys arrived at the island. After Isaac had
spent some time with Ben and Sally, the four
friends strolled up to the old maple. They told
Isaac the history of the holes bored in it, and of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
that had transpired in respect to temperance while
he had been away, and then listened with great
interest to an account of his life at sea, and the
scenes he had witnessed in the East. John at
length inquired if he intended to continue in the
same employ; to which he replied that he did not.</p>

<p>“I see no prospect,” said he, “of being anything
more than mate. Mr. Welch has a great many
relatives who follow the sea, and so have the captains
who have long sailed in his employ, and are
at the same time owners in the vessels they go in.
Captain Radford, I’m with, is an old man. If
there was nobody in the way, he would give me
the vessel in a year or two, for he wants to retire.
But he has a son who is going second mate this
voyage. The next voyage, or the next after, he’ll
put him in captain over my head if I am willing to
remain; and so it is all through. Now, if I had a
vessel,&mdash;any kind of a thing, if it was like the
Ark,&mdash;to get a cargo of spars to Europe, or lumber,
spars, and other truck to the West Indies, I
could pay for it, and build a better one in a short
time; with good luck, make more in one year than
I can going mate in five.”</p>

<p>“I believe that,” said John; “for I know by
what I’ve heard captains in Portland say, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
what Mr. Starrett, that I learned my trade of, who
is concerned in several of these lumber vessels, has
told me.”</p>

<p>“Some of those Portland captains have coined
money; but it is a good deal as you happen to hit.
If you get to a West India port when the market
is empty, you get your own price; if not, you
won’t make much.”</p>

<p>“Only see,” said Fred, “what Captain Rhines
did in the Ark!”</p>

<p>“That was an exception. He arrived off the
harbor of Havana in a peculiar time. Lumber
was scarce, they had no beef for their slavers,
they gave him a license to trade, and the captain-general
remitted the duties. He saved by
that remission more than two thousand five hundred
dollars. The Federal Constitution was not
formed then, and he had no duties to pay in Boston.
However, I’m going to stick where I am this
voyage, and perhaps another, till I get money
enough to take a part of some kind of craft, if it’s
only a pinkie, go round among the neighbors, scare
up owners, and try my luck. I’d rather be a king
among hogs than a hog among kings. I’d rather
be skipper of a chebacco boat than mate of a ship,&mdash;to
sail the vessel, take all the responsibility,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
endure all the anxiety for somebody’s son or
nephew, who runs away with all the credit, and
the money to boot, and don’t know how to knot a
rope-yarn, or handle a ship in a sea-way.”</p>

<p>There was now a pause in the conversation,
when Charlie, who, though an attentive listener,
had not uttered a word, said, speaking deliberately,
“We will build you a vessel, Isaac.”</p>

<p>“<i>We!</i>” replied Isaac in astonishment. “Who’s
<i>we</i>?”</p>

<p>“We three sitting here.”</p>

<p>“Three <i>boys</i> build a vessel!”</p>

<p>“We may be boys, but we are all able to do a
<i>man’s</i> work. I think, as you say you are in no
hurry, give us time, we could build a cheap vessel,
that would be strong and serviceable to carry
heavy cargoes for a few voyages, which you say is
all you want.”</p>

<p>“I think as much,” said Fred. “We three boys
have always been together, and have undertaken
several things, and have never yet failed to accomplish
what we have attempted.”</p>

<p>“But you never undertook anything like this, or
to be compared with it. Building a vessel is quite
another matter from making <i>baskets</i>.”</p>

<p>The reader will bear in mind that Isaac had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
been away during the period in which the boys
had developed most rapidly, and was not so well
aware of what they might be expected to accomplish
as he otherwise would have been.</p>

<p>“But,” asked Isaac, “where are the carpenters
coming from? There are none here but Yelf and
Joe Griffin, and neither of them have ever been
master workmen. You must go to Portland or
Wiscasset for a master workman and blacksmith;
and where is the money to pay them, fit up a
yard, build a blacksmith’s shop, buy tools and
iron?”</p>

<p>“Charlie,” replied John, “can be master workman.”</p>

<p>“John,” said Fred, “can do the iron-work.”</p>

<p>He then told Isaac of their capabilities, and
what they had done since he had been gone,
which greatly astonished him, and presented the
subject under discussion in a very different light,
especially when Charlie told him that he could cut
the timber entirely on his own land, the spars, and
also spars and lumber to load her.</p>

<p>“But,” said Isaac, “you must have carpenters.
You can’t build her alone.”</p>

<p>“To build a vessel in the manner we shall build
one, we don’t need but three good carpenters, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
there are plenty of men round here that can hew,
bore, drive bolts, and saw with a whip-saw. Yelf
is a capital man with an adze, and so is Ralph
Chase. They can do all the dubbing.”</p>

<p>“My uncle can make the spars,” said Isaac.</p>

<p>“Peterson,” said John, “can calk and rig her,
and father and Ben can make the sails.”</p>

<p>“The next question,” said Charlie, “is, What
kind of a vessel do you want?”</p>

<p>“I want her built to lug a load and to steer
well. Speed is no object to what the carrying
part is. The voyages will be short, and wages and
provisions are not high in comparison with the
value of cargoes. I don’t want one cent laid out
for looks. We must go on the principle of the
man who goes on to new land. He lives in a log
cabin, built as cheap as possible, because he expects
to have a better one.”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t have her look too bad,” said
Charlie.</p>

<p>“That’s just the way I want her to look. All
I’m afraid of is, you can’t make her look bad
enough. I want a sloop, with good spars, rigging,
cables, and anchors.”</p>

<p>“What makes you want a sloop?”</p>

<p>“Because she is cheaper rigged and handled.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>“How large?”</p>

<p>“Two hundred tons.”</p>

<p>At this all the boys expressed their astonishment.</p>

<p>“A sloop of two hundred tons! Why, who
ever heard of such a thing!” said Charlie. “The
most of brigs are not more than that, many less.
I never saw a sloop bigger than eighty-five tons.”</p>

<p>“I saw one last week, in Boston, that had just
arrived from Liverpool with a load of salt, that
was one hundred and fifteen. If you want to
carry timber, you must have some bigness, and if
spars, some length.”</p>

<p>“But what an awful mainsail! How could you
ever handle it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of that part of it. Shorten the
mast, and put a good part of the canvas into a
topsail, top-gallant sail, and jibs.”</p>

<p>“I never saw a sloop with a topsail,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“They are common enough,” said Isaac, “though
not round here.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Charlie, “it is best to have a fair
understanding. I think we can build this vessel,
although you want a larger one than I had expected.
We are used to working together, are of
one mind, and, as Fred says, never undertook to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
do anything we didn’t accomplish; but it will be a
hard, trying thing, and we may have to leave off
two or three times, and go to work at something
else to earn money to go on again.”</p>

<p>“I will go mate till you get her done, no matter
how long it is. I shall be contented if I have
something to look forward to.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Fred, “Captain Rhines or Mr.
Ben would help us out if we got stuck.”</p>

<p>“Not with my consent,” said John. “If we’ve
got to fall back on the old folks, I’ll have nothing
to do with it.”</p>

<p>“That is just the way I feel. I only wanted to
see what you would say.”</p>

<p>“My idea is just this,” said Charlie. “If we
conclude to build her, go to work and set her up,
pay our bills as we go along, and before the money
quite runs out, stop and earn more. I’m one of
those chaps that want to know just how I stand
every Saturday night.”</p>

<p>“If we begin,” said John, “we’ve got to go
ahead, for everybody within twenty miles will
know it; and if we slump, we might as well
leave the country.”</p>

<p>“I know just what they’ll say,” replied Charlie.
“They’ll say, there’s a parcel of boys thinking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
they are going to build a vessel, and a nice piece
of work they’ll make of it! lose what little they’ve
earned, and find out they don’t know as much as
they thought for. I wonder Captain Rhines and
Ben allow them to do it!”</p>

<p>“That,” said John, “is just what was said when
we undertook to carry on the farm; but they
didn’t laugh when harvest-time came.”</p>

<p>“You say you want her two hundred tons, but
you have said nothing about the dimensions.”</p>

<p>“I want her a great carrier, and as good a sea-boat
as she can be and carry. I know enough to
know that a vessel can’t be full and fast both; but
there’s a medium, to hit which you know more
about than I do; if you don’t, you know where to
get information. I don’t care how rough she is.
We can’t afford to do anything for looks. She
can’t look worse than the Ark. I wish you could
have heard all that was said when she went into
Havana! Why, the darkies laughed and opened
their mouths till I thought they never would shut
them again. I couldn’t understand Spanish, but
Flour told me what they said. All I have to say
about dimensions is, I want her one hundred feet
long, twenty-six feet beam, eight and a half feet
deep. There is length enough for spars, depth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
enough for two tier of molasses. If you can
make her any other than a great carrier with that
breadth of beam, you’re welcome to. Where
would you build her?”</p>

<p>“At my shore,” said Charlie. “The timber is at
the water’s edge. Never was a better place to set
a vessel.”</p>

<p>“But there’s no house where you could live.”</p>

<p>“Build a log house,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Ten men would build her,” said Charlie,
“especially such men as Joe Griffin, Peterson,
and Yelf. Peterson can use a broadaxe or whip-saw
as well as a calking-iron. Uncle Isaac would
work after haying, and Black Luce could cook
for us.”</p>

<p>“What would you do for a blacksmith’s shop?”</p>

<p>“Build a log one,” said John, “and burn our
own coal.”</p>

<p>“The hardest nip,” said Isaac, “will be the sails,
rigging, and anchors.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” said Charlie; “but if I find the
timber, and turn in my work on the vessel, John
turns in his, Fred pays the men in part out of his
store, then we shall economize what little money
we have to pay the men, buy sails and rigging.”</p>

<p>“Mine will be all cash. I’ll leave what I’ve got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
in Captain Rhines’s hands, part of my two months’
advance, and I can leave a draw-bill on the
owners.”</p>

<p>“How long will you be gone?”</p>

<p>“About two years. We shall trade out
there, or perhaps go from there to Europe and
back.”</p>

<p>“The <i>iron</i> will be a heavy bill,” said John, “for
it will have to be imported.”</p>

<p>“If we make the timbers large, timber her close,
put in plenty of knees and treenails, we can save
on the iron,” said Charlie. “There’s a vast deal to
be saved in a vessel if you don’t stand for looks,
especially if you have <i>time</i>, and the vessel will
answer the purpose just as well. If a man contracts
to build a vessel for so much a ton, in so
many days, he has got to work right through,
short days as well as long, perhaps in bitter cold
weather, when it will take a man one quarter of
the time to thrash his hands, and another quarter to
stamp his feet, and very often the timber has to be
dug out of the snow; then, if iron, wages, or pitch
goes up, he must pay the price; he can’t wait.
But building as <i>we</i> shall, we can take advantage of
all these things, and work in the long days, especially
if we pay as we go along. I’ve known ship-builders
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
who were afraid to discharge a man, lest
he should ask for his money.”</p>

<p>“We are great fellows!” said Isaac. “Here we
are talking about where we will build, and what
we will build, fixing our yard, boarding our men,
making all our calculations, and nobody has even
<i>asked</i> what she’s going to <i>cost</i>. That’s neither
according to reason nor Scripture.”</p>

<p>“Speaking about Scripture,” said Charlie, “just
brings to my mind <i>one thing</i>, that, now we are all
together, I <i>must</i> speak about. Here are three
of us that have professed religion, and Isaac, I
know, respects it.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I do. I wouldn’t have any <i>Murch</i>
blood in me if I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, here we are, laying plans, as I may say,
for life, just starting out to do for ourselves, and
we haven’t one of us done anything for the Lord,
or the support of his gospel.”</p>

<p>“I should think,” replied Fred, “that if we
build this vessel, we shall have about load enough
to carry. When we are twenty-one we shall be
<i>called upon</i>.”</p>

<p>“I think it would be a great deal better not to
wait to be <i>called</i> upon. When we were so hard
put to it, while father was paying for this island,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
and had to live mostly on clams and sea-fowl,
before we got any news from the Ark, and didn’t
know as we ever should, he, in his <i>poverty</i>, paid
something for the support of the gospel. I think,
when we are not pressed in any way, only pressing
ourselves, we ought to do <i>something</i>.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” replied John. “Don’t you know,
Fred, how hard we worked to make that garden,
and cut the hay on Griffin’s Island, just to let Ben
and Sally know that we had hearts and consciences,
knew when we were well used, and who
our friends were? I would like to show my
heavenly Father the same thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk, John,” said Isaac. “I’ll do my
part.”</p>

<p>“So will I,” said Fred, “and I’m ashamed I said
what I did; but you know I always was meaner
than the rest of you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know any such thing,” said John.
“You’ve had your parents to help, while we’ve
had all we’ve earned, and all our clothes given us.
I didn’t mean we should give <i>much</i>, nor all alike,
but we’ll make a beginning. By and by, perhaps,
we can do more.”</p>

<p>“Now I feel right,” said Charlie, “and we’ll talk
<i>vessel</i>. I didn’t say anything about the price, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
this is all talk. We shouldn’t feel like <i>doing</i>
anything,&mdash;at least I shouldn’t,&mdash;before asking
father, Captain Rhines, and Uncle Isaac. They
are the best friends we’ve got in the world, know
every crook and turn, and ain’t like some old folks,
who think everybody must be forty years old before
they can do anything.”</p>

<p>“We might as well talk about price,” said Isaac,
“as about the rest. What do you imagine she
would cost?”</p>

<p>“The man I worked for in Portland sold a vessel
of two hundred tons, hull and spars, for sixteen
dollars per ton. He bought the stump leave of
the timber, and hired it hauled six miles.”</p>

<p>“That would be three thousand two hundred
dollars for the hull and spars.”</p>

<p>“Yes; what it would cost for rigging, sails, and
the rest, you know better than I do.”</p>

<p>“It would cost about half as much more.”</p>

<p>Timber, labor, and board were cheap then&mdash;canvas,
rigging, and iron extremely high.</p>

<p>“But then it ain’t a going to cost us near that to
build the same number of tons.”</p>

<p>“Neither is it going to cost so much to rig and
spar a sloop as a brig.”</p>

<p>“Nor so much for iron-work,” said John. “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
more spars, the more chain-plates, blocks, bolts,
bands, boom-irons to make, and caps to iron.”</p>

<p>“I believe she could be built in the way we
should build her for twelve dollars per ton, and I
don’t know but less, hull and spars. The timbers
and spars are not much account here; the hauling
is nothing. But she will be an awful <i>looking</i>
thing, though!”</p>

<p>“Then she would cost two thousand four
hundred dollars, six hundred to a share, hull and
spars, and half as much more to rig her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know she can be built for that; but there
won’t be a brush full of paint on her, and I don’t
know but the name will have to be put on with
<i>chalk</i>. <i>I</i> wouldn’t go to a foreign port in her.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> will, though. I’m fire-proof. I’ve been in
the <i>Ark</i>. Let us calculate. Twelve dollars per
ton. I can take a quarter at that rate, and more
on a pinch; for in addition to my wages, I have
made something by ventures.”</p>

<p>“I can take a quarter,” said Fred, “if I can
have orders to pay some of the men out of the
store.”</p>

<p>“I,” said Charlie, “can take a quarter by turning
in my labor. If I hadn’t bought my land, I could
have taken more.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said John, “I can take a quarter, and
turn in my work.”</p>

<p>“What we want to know,” said Isaac, “is, how
much <i>cash</i> we can raise to pay the men, buy iron,
rig her, and for other materials. I can pay my
part in cash by the time it is wanted, and six hundred
dollars of it now.”</p>

<p>“I,” said Fred, “can pay in cash one hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p>“I,” said John, “two hundred.”</p>

<p>“I,” said Charlie, “one hundred.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s so much to begin with. Now
the question is, <i>can</i> we begin with that?”</p>

<p>“We will carry all these calculations to father,”
said Charlie, “and ask him.”</p>

<p>It was dark when they arrived at the house.</p>

<p>“Why, boys,” said Ben, “where have you been
all this time?”</p>

<p>“I should have thought,” said Sally, “hunger
would have brought you home before this. I told
Ben you must have camped again in the top of
the old maple. I’m afraid you’ll have but a cold
supper.”</p>

<p>“I declare,” said Charlie, “I never once thought
about supper.”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d been to supper,” said John.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>“You must have had some interesting matter on
hand.”</p>

<p>“The most interesting thing in the world,” said
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Do let me know what it is.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to after supper.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>GENIUS STRUGGLING WITH DIFFICULTIES.</small></h2>

<p>When the meal was concluded, the boys all
surrounded Ben, and Charlie laid the whole matter
before him. To their great delight and no
little surprise, Ben gave his unqualified assent,
told them they had a great and difficult enterprise
before them, but that he admired their resolution,
and to go ahead. When he concluded,
there was a dead silence. Charlie was completely
nonplussed, for he had arranged a series of arguments
to meet the objections he supposed his father
would make; and though he hoped, with the aid
of his mother, to carry the point, he expected and
was prepared to exert his powers of persuasion to
the utmost. This hearty approval quite disconcerted
him, and he was very much in the situation of
Uncle Isaac, when he took Sally over to Elm
Island to see her future home, prepared for tears,
and, to his utter amazement, was greeted with a
hearty, ringing laugh.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>“But, father,” asked Charlie, “do you think
we’ve got money enough?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, plenty to begin with; you’ve got
enough, upon the largest calculations, to set her up,
plank her, get out all your deck plank, water-ways
and spars, and have them seasoning;” and without
paying the least attention to Charlie’s “ifs” and
“ands,” Ben went right on, to inquire where he
was going to build her.</p>

<p>“At my shore,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“But,” said Isaac, “ought we not, I especially, to
ask your father’s advice? He was my earliest
friend, set me agoing, and has always been interested
in me. I shouldn’t have been alive to-day if it
had not been for him.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; but he will approve of it; so we
can go on and talk.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Rhines,” said Fred, “isn’t she a monster?”</p>

<p>“No, Fred, not one whit too large to carry lumber
or molasses; she won’t be as big as the Ark;
and the English mast and timber ships that come
to Wiscasset and Portsmouth, are seven hundred
tons and rising.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she large for a sloop, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but, as Isaac says, it will cost less to rig
her, take less men to handle her, and if you find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
she don’t work well, you can stick another mast
in her any time. Boys, let me plan a little for
you; build her here, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“O, father, what an awful job it would be to
bring all the timber from Pleasant Point, over
here! and how much it would cost!”</p>

<p>“It won’t cost near as much as it would to build
her there. If you build her there, all you’ve got is
the timber; you must build a house to live in with
a chimney, and even if it is a log house, it will
cost something; you must hire or buy cattle to
haul your timber, hay to keep them on, and somebody
to cook for you. I’ve got a piece of land that
I want cleared: if you will fall the whole piece for
me, you can take your timber out of it. I’ll board
your men for less than it would cost you to board
them, a great deal; you and John won’t have to
pay any board, for you’ll be at home.”</p>

<p>“But it’s <i>pine</i> timber, father.”</p>

<p>“Well, build her of pine; the trees are big
enough to hew all the sap off, and it will last as
long as you want her to, and she will be so buoyant
you can’t load her.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Isaac, “the keel, stem, stern-post, and
keelson must be hard wood, or oak.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s hard wood enough for that on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
lot; there’s rock maple for keel, yellow birch for
keelson, stem and stern knees, and spruce for
knees above. Charlie can get oak stem, stern-post,
breast-hooks, or any other particular sticks for bitts
or rudder he may want, at Pleasant Point.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of a vessel being built of pine,”
said Charlie.</p>

<p>“I have; the Russians build all their frigates of
fir, that ain’t one quarter as good. There was a
brig built at Salem of pine before the war, and
I’ve heard she’s a capital vessel; she has been to
India three or four times, and they say, though
she is sharp, she is so light she carries first rate.
This old-growth, thin sap, pumpkin pine will outlast
any oak, and won’t eat up the iron, nor cost near
as much to work it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so: there would be a great difference
between dubbing pine and oak, or in sawing out
plank with a whip-saw.”</p>

<p>“So there would in hewing, and all through;
there’s nothing better for beams than a heart of
hemlock.”</p>

<p>“O, father, folks think hemlock ain’t worth anything.”</p>

<p>“They will think differently one of these days:
see how long a hemlock stub will stand, or a windfall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
last, in the woods. There’s hemlock rails in
our fence, that my grandfather put there more
than a hundred years ago; they are worn thin in
the weather, but are just as sound as ever. It’s all
a notion about oak. Unless you want to build a
vessel of six or seven hundred tons, to carry iron,
salt, or stone, pine is just as good only make it
larger.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure, father, it would be a great deal better
for us to build her here, and we are all very
much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>The others all expressed their gratitude to Ben.</p>

<p>“There are other things,” said he, “that will be
quite an object with you: here is a good work-shop
to shoot treenails, keep your tools in, and to
work in rainy days. There’s the barn floor, where
you can use the whip-saw in the winter if you
want to; then here are six great fat oxen, doing
nothing, that you can take to haul your timber,
which will all come down hill, and you can haul
it as well on bare ground as on the snow. Here is
a whip-saw, a cross-cut saw, and a threefold tackle;
thus, you see there are many advantages in building
here rather than in the woods; besides, if I
am round, you can call on me when you have a
hard lift or a wale piece to lug; you can give me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
a lift in haying or hoeing, and that will be a mutual
benefit.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do that, father; we’ll put the haying
through.”</p>

<p>After the boys went up to bed, they expressed
in no measured terms, to each other, their surprise
at the readiness with which Ben had entered into
their plans, and our readers may also feel the
same; but the fact was, the boys had merely anticipated
purposes which had for some time occupied
the thoughts of Captain Rhines, Uncle Isaac,
and Ben, and, indeed, been a matter of conversation
between them.</p>

<p>They had long cherished the desire to make
their property a source of benefit to their neighbors,
the place where they lived, and the young
men growing up around them. Captain Rhines
wanted to take advantage of the facilities for ship-building
furnished by the forests, and give to the
young men growing up lucrative employment at
home. He had, therefore, watched with great interest
the development of Charlie’s capacities in
that direction, and for the same reason did all in
his power to train Isaac, not merely in the matter
of seamanship, but also to inculcate those
principles of integrity more valuable than silver
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
or gold; and he was more pleased than he cared
to show when John wanted to learn the trade of a
blacksmith.</p>

<p>“When these boys get older,” said the captain
to Ben and Uncle Isaac, “we’ll raise our own
mechanics and seamen, and make the place what
it ought to be.”</p>

<p>Thus, in Ben’s opinion, it mattered very little
whether the boys had half money enough or not.
He was pleased with their grit, told them to go
ahead, intending, whenever their means failed,
to help them out. The boys met with the like
encouragement from Captain Rhines and Uncle
Isaac, none of them aware, however, of the
compact the boys had entered into to receive
no aid, or dreaming that they would refuse it
if proffered.</p>

<p>Captain Rhines now drew up their building
contract in due form, although it was good for
nothing in law, since no one of them was of age,
except Isaac, and he but just twenty-one, though
he called the others <i>boys</i>.</p>

<p>“Now, Mary,” said Captain Rhines, rubbing his
hands, after the boys had gone, “we’ve got all our
chickens at home once more, and we shall see what
they will do.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>The boys lost no time in giving him the desired
information.</p>

<p>The birch they were going to build on Indian
Island, the pickerel they were to catch in Charlie’s
pond, the bears they were to kill, and exploring
expeditions to be undertaken, were forgotten,
driven from their minds by the expulsive power
of this new affection.</p>

<p>It is not our design to enter into the details of
ship-building. Boys, if they want to build ships,
must begin with boats, and go into the ship-yard,
as Charlie did, where they will find competent
instructors. We intend merely to give such details
as may note the progress made, and show the
indomitable energy of those who laid the foundations
of our commerce, the difficulties with which
they were compelled to struggle, and the rude
beginnings from which the fleet, and beautiful
specimens of naval architecture that now grace
our seaports, have grown.</p>

<p>There was no scientific draughting of vessels then.
No close models, or even rack models. There were,
indeed, among carpenters, some few general principles;
but the whole shaping of the vessel was by
the eye, judgment, guess-work.</p>

<p>Let us see how Charlie went to work; for it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
not much like the way ship-builders go to work
now, and quite original. He took a piece of
board, a little over two feet in length by one in
width, and planed it perfectly smooth. This he
dignified with the name of a draughting-board, although,
as we proceed, our readers may think there
was very little draughting about it. Charlie dearly
loved a sharp model. He wanted something that
would sail. His first model was a mackerel. His
first efforts in boat-building had all been in that
direction, and were successful. His tastes would
have been gratified had he been set to build a
clipper or a pilot-boat. He was now compelled to
do violence to these inclinations, by stern necessity
to abjure all ideas of grace and beauty, consult
only <i>profit</i>, and build this “box,” as he termed her.
He was not devoid of experience in this direction.
It was just the kind of vessel he had worked upon
in Portland, designed for the same business, with
the exception that there were some attempts at
finish about them, the wales and bulwarks being
foreplaned. In the cabin was some joiner-work;
the wales and bulwarks were daubed with lampblack,
fish-oil, and red ochre, but the bottom was
left rough, and pitched. Here their means would
admit of no such attempt at ornament.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>Captain Rhines and Ben had determined to
allow the boys to proceed entirely in their own
way, giving no advice till it was asked, nor offering
to aid till they were in <i>extremity</i>.</p>

<p>Charlie was by no means inclined to adopt
notions without examination. He knew from the
report of all the sea captains that the vessels Mr.
Foss built, though carrying enormous cargoes, and
<i>profitable</i>, were, when deep loaded,&mdash;and that was
nearly all the time,&mdash;terrible things to steer and
live in, and would not sail much more than a raft,
and <i>thought</i> he knew the reason. They were so
full aft, and the transoms so low, that when this
great buttock was brought into the water by a
heavy cargo, they could not be otherwise than
unmanageable. The bilge also went up with a
square turn, resembling a scow. Without presuming
to criticise, Charlie, while at work, had
been constantly revolving these matters in his
mind, listening to the criticisms made, and the
improvements suggested, by masters and seamen.
He knew the Perseverance sailed well and steered
well, no matter whether she was deep or light, and
so did his boats.</p>

<p>“I’ll see if I can’t make her steer and sail a little
better than a log, and carry just as much,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Charlie, as he sat under the big maple with the
board on his knees, a piece of chalk and compasses
in his hand. “I’ll give her a round side, instead
of a square knuckle.”</p>

<p>He at length determined, while giving her a long
floor and large breadth of beam, to cut through at
the bow and stern, and sharpen the ends something
like his boats, instead of keeping them full,
like the vessels he had worked on. Upon a scale
of a quarter of an inch to a foot, he drew lines to
represent his keel, stem, and stern-post. He then
marked on the keel the dead rise amidships, forward,
and aft, and with a limber batten drew a
line through these points, forming a true sweep.
This he called the rising line. On this line he
divided up the rise on every timber, giving a very
long floor, kept well out forward; next marked on
the keel the length of his floor at the midships,
forward and after frames, drew a line through these
points, which he called his shortening line, to regulate
the length of the floor timbers, and also dividing
them up on this line, marked the respective
lengths by letters of the alphabet, as he had their
dead rise by numbers; marked on perpendiculars
drawn from the keel the breadth both amidships,
forward, and aft, and the depth, and drew a line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
through these points, representing the shape of the
top and the hanging wale. The curve of the stem
and the rake of the stern-post not suiting him, he
rubbed out his work, and drew it again and again,
till he was satisfied; then went to the shop, and
with a pencil and dividers, took it off on the other
side of the board, making some little further alterations.
These three lines on a board were all that
Charlie had to guide him, as far as lines were concerned,
in building his vessel. He now wanted to
represent the round of the side, that he might see
how it would look on a larger scale than he could
if on a board, and took a queer method to obtain
his end.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the brook was a flat, smooth
beach of white sand, so hard that when wet
an ox would not print it with his foot. He
tool a pole eighteen feet in length, drove a nail
through one end of it, bored a hole in the other
end, and made a long, pointed peg to fit it. He
represented on the sand the actual length of the
vessel, stem, stern, and floor timbers; then, fastening
one end of the pole to the ground by the peg,
in such a manner that it would revolve, he, by
means of the nail in the other end, swept out the
round of the whole side, till he got a shape to suit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
him, then took it off, and reducing it to a proper
scale, transferred it to his board.</p>

<p>His draughting, such as it was, being thus
finished, he was prepared, having the proportions
and dimensions, to make his moulds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>SCATTERING FRAMES.</small></h2>

<p>By the modern process of scientific draughting,
an exact mould of every timber in the vessel is made
in the moulding loft, from lines drawn on the floor,
the bevel of each timber ascertained, and marked
on the mould. These moulds are then taken into
the forest, or wherever the timber in its rough state
is, and it is hewed out to these moulds.</p>

<p>They are often packed up, taken to Virginia or
Delaware, and the whole frame of a vessel moulded
with such accuracy, that when it is brought
home and set up, if it does not come within half
an inch, it is considered bungling work.</p>

<p>Thus a vessel can be commenced at different
points, by different parties of workmen, and built
with the greatest despatch. All that is needed is
men and money enough. They can all be at work
at once, and a large ship can be built in ninety
days as well as in a thousand. One gang begin to
stretch out and put together the keel, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
brought into the yard rough-hewed, and put on
the midship frames, which are put together and
raised at once. While this is being done, another
gang are at work upon the stern, another upon the
stem, which are ready to go up with the rest, another
making the windlass, and still another the
rudder. In the mean time the blacksmith, knowing
the exact model of the future ship, and size of
everything, can make the iron-work ahead, before
the stem and stern are set up. Another gang
begin to put on the plank, and another, whose
business it is, bore every hole and drive every bolt.
The joiners plane the whole outside of the ship,
smooth up everything, and do all that comes in
their line. The calkers and painters follow close
at their heels, and after them the riggers.</p>

<p>But all this accuracy and despatch, resulting
from a division of labor, has been a work of time,
brought about by the efforts of many minds, and
from very rude beginnings.</p>

<p>We cannot go into detail. It is sufficient to say
that, in the present system of what is termed close
modelling in this country, the master workman
puts together with screws or keys, so they can be
taken apart at pleasure, some pieces of soft pine,
half an inch in thickness, three feet, two, or eighteen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
inches in length, according as he intends to
go upon the scale of a fourth of an inch or an
eighth, more or less, to a foot.</p>

<p>From this block he cuts out half his future vessel,
making it to suit his eye. As these pieces,
being in leaves, can all be taken apart, he can take
by measurement the exact proportions of every
part on the floor of a large loft, mark them down,
enlarged to the full size, and from these make his
moulds of every timber.</p>

<p>It is evident that the mechanical genius here
lies in making this model, shaping the vessel in the
mind of the architect. All, after this, is a matter
of measurement and arithmetic. It requires mathematical
ability to take off this complicated system
of lines from the model, a clear head and mechanical
ability to make the moulds; but after this any one
who can handle tools can follow the patterns, and
cut out the timber. But carpenters were hundreds
of years getting as far as this, although they were
building vessels all the time, some very good,
where the workman was possessed of superior
genius; but the great majority were wretched
models, requiring an enormous waste of time,
labor, and timber.</p>

<p>The first decided approach to the present method
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
was the rack model, which consists in fastening
several pieces of board edgewise to a flat surface,
to represent the frames of a vessel, and cutting out
the model on the edges of these. By measurements
from these, the moulds were made, which
insured accuracy, economized labor and timber.
The first water-line model now in use was made
by Orlando B. Merrill, of Newburyport, in 1794;
but, like all new things, there were prejudices
against it. The old carpenters would have nothing
to do with the “newfangled thing.”</p>

<p>It was a long time before it was used in Massachusetts,
and thirty-six years getting into Maine.
The first vessel built from the new plan there was
the ship Burmah, of Portland, built by Water-house,
from New York, in 1831, for the Messrs.
Oxnards, who came there and modelled her; but,
after all, she was not so good a vessel as many built
on the old plan, to the great delight of the old
carpenters, who “knew it would turn out just so.”
Even then they got no farther than the forward
and after frames, but had to timber out the ends
by guess for a long time. The fact is, the ground
of success lies in originating the model. Thus the
same principles are involved in both methods,
whether a man holds all the proportions of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
vessel in his mind to a great extent, sets her up,
and makes his model as he goes along, altering his
ribbands and cutting his frames to suit his ideas, or
does it all on a block of wood beforehand. The
same man will build as good a model in one way
as the other. The difference is, that in one case
he knows, when he has made his model, precisely
what kind of a vessel he will have. The draughting
from the model is a matter of mathematics. The
result must follow as inevitably as a sum in the
rule of three, if rightly stated and accurately
worked. In the other way he cannot know this
till she is timbered out. To work by the first
method, some little education is needed; in the
other, not the least.</p>

<p>Another more important matter is the great saving
of time, rendering it possible for all parts of a
vessel to go on together, and the great saving of
timber.</p>

<p>The man who works from the modern plan
knows just what wood he needs to form every
timber; whereas, in the old way, some of the timbers
were half cut off, some had to be thrown
away, and others that would not fill up the ribband
furred out; but neither time nor timber was worth
a third as much then as now. A mast that cost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
sixty dollars then now costs two hundred and
forty dollars, while those of the largest size cannot
be obtained at all, but must be <i>made</i> in pieces and
hooped. A carpenter who was worth a dollar a
day then is worth four now, and it costs twice as
much to feed him.</p>

<p>You will perceive, my young friends, there is
the same, and even greater, scope for ability now
than there was then, with this difference, that
there is a greater opportunity for sham. Ship-carpenters
can now pony in ship-building as well
as in these days of mathematical keys and translations;
students can “pony” in algebra and &AElig;schylus.
Then they had to make their own keys and
unlock their own doors.</p>

<p>All the way a carpenter, who was a good mechanic,
but not possessed of ability to model a vessel,
could build one, was to get some one who had to
timber her out to the ribbands, after which he could
finish her; but then everybody knew it. Now a
person, by paying for it, may (privately) get any
kind of a model he likes, build from it, and nobody&mdash;or
but a very few&mdash;the wiser. Thus a man
with modern helps can build vessels, and good
ones, who, for the life of him, could not have gone
to work, set up, and built a vessel, as Charlie did
on Elm Island.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>A master workman meant brains then, though
the workmanship was rough and the beginnings
rude. Even in this first rudest form of building,
accuracy, by a person of genius, could be obtained.
If they made one side of the vessel fuller than the
other, it was the result of negligence, not of necessity,
by suffering their shores to slip, or not proving
their work by a plumb line.</p>

<p>Mr. Foss was one of those rude beginners. He
built vessels on the same general principle as the
May Flower. Charlie was another; but having
received the instructions of Mr. Foss, listened to
the remarks of seamen, the result of experience in
the actual management of vessels, and with greater
genius than his master, he had already, and even in
this rude craft, made improvements. What is
more, they were improvements that he had originated,
and the principles of which were first suggested
to his mind by taking the model from
the fish.</p>

<p>We have seen how perfectly prepared the scientific
draughtsman is to go with his moulds into
the forest, and mould his timber. Let us now
ascertain how our young ship-builder, alone on
Elm Island, went to work from the scanty data he
had to make moulds to cut timber by. All his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
three lines told him was the shape of the floor
timbers, the proportional length of them, the shape
and sheer of the top; and his pole, with a nail in
it, the sweep of the side.</p>

<p>He made moulds from his rising line of the floor
timbers, of the stem and stern-post from their
shape on the board; his shortening line gave him a
water line along the heads of his floor timbers, the
rising-line the shape of the bottom.</p>

<p>But now his lines fail him. He has not, like the
scientific draughtsman, a line for every timber, from
which to make his moulds. Well, he don’t make
any more, except five or six, of what he calls
“scattering frames.” His third line has given him
the length of the vessel, and general shape on top,
and the sweep on the sand of the way in which
her side will round; and he goes to work, and
makes by his eye, and what aid he can derive from
these moulds futtocks, naval, and top timbers,
which, put together, form the side, cuts and alters
them till they suit his eye; and that is all there is
about it. When he gets them done, he calls them
the moulds of the scattering frames. He makes
five or six of them, perhaps more&mdash;one amidships,
one at the forward and one at the after floor timber.
They are called scattering frames because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
they are scattered along the keel for guides. By
and by we shall see what he will do with them.
Instead of making, as is now done, a mould for
every timber, amounting to hundreds, and occupying
weeks, he makes no more. His moulds are all
made, and he is ready to cut his timber. He will,
however, lose four times the amount of time,
fussing, guessing, and moulding his vessel as he
goes along, and doing work over two or three
times, than he would if he had known the present
method.</p>

<p>In cutting timber there is a great deal of work
to be done with the narrow axe, and a great deal
of digging out roots for knees, for which it is not
necessary to employ skilled labor. There were
also, in this new country, many men who had
been used all their lives to handling a broadaxe,
hewing ton timber for exportation to Europe, and
ranging timber for the frames of buildings. The
saw-mills, in those days, especially in new places,
where there were not means to purchase machinery,
were in a very imperfect state, possessed but
little power, could not saw greater length than
twenty feet, while the carriage, instead of being
run back by touching a lever, and by the power of
the water-wheel, as at the present day, was slowly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
and laboriously pushed back by turning a wheel
with the foot. Mill-cranks were all imported from
England, and people, under the pressure of necessity,
made cranks of a crooked root, sometimes
hunting for weeks in the woods to find one that
had the right turn, and was of tough wood. This
was the case with the mill in Charlie’s vicinity,
which, however, was six miles off.</p>

<p>In this state of things there was a great deal of
sawing done with a whip-saw. It was cheaper, in
many cases, to do this than to haul the timber a
great distance to a mill. There was no other way
when plank and boards were required longer than
the mills; but with the whip-saw you could have
it whatever length you wished. In ship-building
it is especially desirable to have the stuff as long
as can be worked, as there will be fewer joints to
calk, less danger of leaks, and greater strength.
Even now a great deal of long stuff is sawed with
a whip-saw.</p>

<p>This species of labor then being so much in
vogue, plenty of men could be found, who, from
youth, had been accustomed to the use of the
broadaxe and whip-saw. They were not carpenters,
could not edge planks, fay knees, make
scarfs in keels, as Joe Griffin, Uncle Isaac, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
Yelf could; but for cutting timber in the woods,
beating it out, with a master workman to boss
them, and for two thirds of the work in the ship-yard,
they were just as good, and would work for
a great deal less wages.</p>

<p>John Rhines, who would not have any blacksmith
work to occupy him till they began to put
the timber together, was equally useful with the
narrow axe in cutting, and as a teamster in hauling
the timber. Charlie, who was keenly alive to all
these matters, sat down, pencil in hand, to calculate.</p>

<p>“My plank,” he said, “and wales must be sawed
with a whip-saw. My deck plank, I need about
nine thousand five hundred feet; wales, three
thousand three hundred; outboard and ceiling
plank, two thousand four hundred feet.”</p>

<p>Knowing the price of sawing at the mill per thousand,
how many feet two men would saw in a day,
and about what it would cost to hire the kind of
men I have described, who could saw and hew
both, he found he could saw his deck plank
for less on the island than it would cost to raft
the logs to the mill, have them sawed, and get
them back.</p>

<p>In addition to this, he knew what length the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
mill would saw, and that, as the planks must butt
on the beams, there would be a piece to cut off of
almost every plank, when he would lose the timber,
and expense of sawing and cutting; whereas,
knowing the exact dimensions of his deck, he
could cut his logs the length he wanted them, lose
no timber, and only pay for cutting and sawing
what he used.</p>

<p>The first thing Charlie did, after making these
calculations, was to construct fixtures for four men
to saw, both out of doors and in the barn, make a
gin, with a windlass and a tackle on it, to hoist the
timber up on the stage. Thus, in fair weather,
they could work beside the vessel, and in stormy
weather in the barn.</p>

<p>When the two boys had arranged these matters,
Charlie hired four men, such as we have described.
Two of them were Eaton and his brother; one
of whom, Danforth, shaved the clapboards for
Ben’s house. The others were Thorndike, that
smart man who worked with Uncle Isaac, and
helped the boys plough the garden; the other, our
old acquaintance, Joel Ricker, who came to Elm
Island to wrestle with Ben. By the advice of
Uncle Isaac, Charlie sent for him.</p>

<p>“You don’t want many men,” said Uncle Isaac,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
“because Ben has not room for a great crowd; so
you must have them strong. He’s a master strong,
smart man, and he’ll be a real pleasant fellow,
now Ben has brought him to his bearings, and
taken the wind out of him. Then, when you come
to have Joe, Yelf, and one or two more, you’ll have
a whole team, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“And you, Uncle Isaac, O, do come!”</p>

<p>“Well, if I can get anybody to do my harvesting,
I will, when you begin to put timber together,
and need carpenters.”</p>

<p>Charlie hired the four men for three shillings each,
per day. The first thing he cut was the stocks for
deck plank, hauled them out, and some of them into
the barn, in order to keep his men at work sawing
in rainy weather, and in order to permit the plank to
season. He next began to cut his floor. We have
said that the modern carpenter takes a mould
for every timber into the woods. What do you
suppose Charlie did? He took a pole, thirteen feet
long, the length of his longest floor timber, with
the dead rise of each timber marked on one side,
and the length of each, in letters of the alphabet,
on the other. This he called the rising rod.
When the men cut a stick, he laid this across it,
and measured down from the middle for his rise,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
according to the scale on the rod, and lined it out;
then they cut it the right length, and beat off the
wood to lighten it for hauling. As for the other
timber, knowing the length, he guessed at the
shape.</p>

<p>In this rude way, to modern eyes, he cut his
frame; and in about forty days the timber was in
the yard, and the stocks for planks and wales at
the saw-pit. It required no small degree of
mechanical ability to build a vessel in this way.
Sometimes they got them fuller on one side, so
they would sail faster on one tack than the other.
It was just like preaching without notes. Sometimes
you’ll hit first rate, and then again you
won’t.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>CHARLIE ACHIEVES SUCCESS.</small></h2>

<p>In the modern mode of building, the carpenter
will stretch out his keel, begin to timber out in the
middle, perhaps timber out as far as the forward
and after frames, and even put in some ceiling,
before raising the stem and stern, because the
vessel is all modelled, and he can put every timber
in her, and hold her together with ribbands without
putting on a single plank. But in the old mode,
nothing could be done without the stem and stern-post,
as they were needed to shape her by. We
shall now see what use Charlie made of his scattering
frames, as he called them, since they are
to play a very important part.</p>

<p>Although Charlie was not working by contract,
and limited as to time, yet he thought he should
need ten men to handle the timber, which was all
green and of large size, especially as, being on an
island, it was not very easy to procure more. He
already had six; Uncle Isaac, Joe, and Yelf would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
make nine: four of these, however, would be employed
in sawing, and the whip-saw must be in
steady use, in order that plank and wales might
be in readiness, since, in his method of working
he must plank up as he went along; it was also necessary
that his deck plank should be sawed out
and stuck up to season. This would leave him but
five men to work on the frame and handle the
timber. He therefore hired four more. He could,
upon occasion, call the men from the saw-pit, John
from the anvil, and, more than all, he could have
the aid of Ben, in case of a heavy lift. Ben’s
house now very much resembled a bee-hive, both
as to the number of its inhabitants and their industry.
There was no ten-hour system then. It
was, begin with the sun and work as long as you
can see to pick up your tools. But on the other
hand, as the men were not so particular as at the
present day, to work just so long to a minute, insomuch
that, if the axe is uplifted, and the clock
strikes six, they won’t let it fall, so neither was the
employer. The master workman was not always
on the watch to see if a man stopped to rest his
back or light his pipe; whether he ground his
tools in his own time or that of his employer: if a
man had a first-rate story, not too long to tell, he
told it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>Sometimes, if a coon ran across the yard, or a
squirrel got in among the timbers of the vessel,
the master workman would go for him with the
whole crew at his heels; and then, enlivened by a
little fun, they would work enough faster to make it
up. Where all were neighbors, men of principle,
and calculated to earn their wages, and unwilling
to be outdone, there was no necessity for drawing
lines, as with the kind of labor often found in yards
at the present day.</p>

<p>Henry Griffin, coming home from sea, resolved
to give it up, and learn the blacksmith’s trade, as
he was, like all the Griffins, strong, willing, and ingenious.
John gladly received him as an apprentice.
Thus the family, including the children and
Sally’s hired girl, numbered twenty-two. Taking
away the partition between the workshop and the
wood-shed, they threw it all into one room, which
made a splendid workshop in rainy weather, large
enough to hew timber or joint deck plank. The
chamber overhead they filled with beds, while
Charlie, John, Henry, and Ben, Jr., slept in the sap
camp. It was such a handy place, after they had
worked from sun to sun, to run out and shoot
a coon among the corn in the moonlight evenings!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>The stem and stern-posts were bolted on to the
keel, lying on the ground; the whole was raised
together and held in position with shores, and the
transom bolted on when it was half up. Charlie
now took the moulds and moulded his scattering
frames, and fastened them, together with the floor
timbers, to the keel. These frames, extending from
the keel to the deck, and ranged along at intervals
from stem to stern, kept in position by spruce
poles spiked to them and to the stern and transom,
and also to cross pawls at their tops, gave the outline
of the whole vessel. In the modern process
of working, the timber, being all accurately moulded
from the draught, the timbering out is a very
rapid process&mdash;the planking, fastening, and finishing
occupying a much greater length of time.</p>

<p>But in respect to Charlie, the regulating of these
scattering frames, being accomplished entirely by
the eye, was not only a good deal of work, but it
was a very anxious period, since upon this depended
the whole shape of his vessel.</p>

<p>It was no light matter for a boy, not quite
twenty, with such men as Uncle Isaac, Joe, and
Yelf looking on, to model a vessel.</p>

<p>They offered no advice; Charlie asked none.
He would set up a scattering frame, squint at it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
draw it in or let it out, cut it away, shape it with
the axe or adze to suit his eye, then put up another.
He proved his work by a plumb-line, as
he was determined that one side should not be
fuller than the other.</p>

<p>This doing and undoing,&mdash;for some of the frames
were cut half off,&mdash;occupied a vast deal of time, as
nothing could be prepared beforehand. It was not
so very slow work when they tumbled them in
any how, letting anything go that came within
hail, not concerning themselves whether she was
fuller one side than the other; but it <i>was</i> in
Charlie’s way, who would have everything in proportion,
however rough it might be, no matter
how much time it occupied.</p>

<p>The weather was cold, the ground hard-frozen.
Charlie was anxious to plank up before he left off.
The custom was to plank up to the heads of the
floor timbers, then put in another set, plank up to
them, and so on.</p>

<p>“Uncle Isaac,” said he, “the scattering frames
are all in, and nearly all the others. You can see
the shape of her. How do you like her? I’ll
make any alterations that you or father think for
the best.”</p>

<p>“Don’t disturb anything. Don’t start a cross-band
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
or a ribband. She’ll steer well, carry like
blazes, sail well for a full vessel, or I’m much mistaken.
Joe and your father are of the same
opinion.”</p>

<p>“She looks better than I expected,” said Charlie,
drawing a long breath, struggling to conceal his
delight under an appearance of indifference. “I
wish we were able to finish her in good shape,
smooth her up, and paint her.”</p>

<p>“I can see the boat-model in her. You haven’t
got that out of your head, and I hope you never
will.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Uncle Isaac. I’ll
build a yawl for her, that shall be as handsome as
any of the boats Isaac will run afoul of&mdash;you see
if I don’t. Do you think it would do to plank
with these green plank? or would they shrink all
up&mdash;make an open seam to eat up oakum?”</p>

<p>“Shrink? No, indeed! They are froze as hard
as a rock, and won’t shrink one mite if you put
them on frozen.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. A piece of timber, hard-frozen,
is as small as ever it will be. I’ve laid a house-floor
with boards green from the mill, in the dead
of winter, put them down froze, and the next July
you couldn’t put a pin in the joints.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>“Then I will plank her up, and knock off till
spring. It is not profitable to hire in these short,
cold days. John and I will do what we can this
winter, which will make our money hold out.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to make your treenails
of?”</p>

<p>“White oak, of course.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“What would you make them of?”</p>

<p>“Spruce limbs.”</p>

<p>“Spruce limbs? That’s a funny thing to make
a treenail of!”</p>

<p>“They are better than white oak. They are
hard, stiff, all heart, and full of pitch. They’ll
never rot.”

<small>DIFFICULTIES WHET THE EDGE OF RESOLUTION.</small></h2>

<p>While Charlie and his men were hewing the
timber, John Rhines and his apprentice were getting
ready to do the iron-work.</p>

<p>They built a blacksmith’s shop of logs,&mdash;the floor
was of earth,&mdash;made a bench, and shove-windows.
Leaving the rest to complete in rainy days, they
began to prepare coal. Very little coal, except
charcoal, was then used by blacksmiths, small
quantities being imported from England into the
seaports, but none at all used in the country
shops.</p>

<p>The boys could not afford to buy it. John and
Henry went into the woods, and cut birch and
maple into proper lengths for their purpose.
Then, on a flat piece of ground they built up a
little cobwork of small sticks of dry wood, forming
a little chimney about six feet high. They
then set green sticks of cord-wood up around this
chimney in a slanting direction, filling the interval
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
between with short sticks. When a sufficient
quantity of wood was set up, they rounded the
top with shorter sticks. They dug green, strong
turf, and covered the pile all over with it, grass-side
down, except the top of the chimney, and
some air-holes at the bottom, to make draught
enough to keep the fire steadily burning. Then
they threw earth all over it, and stopped the
cracks where the pieces of turf came together,
filled the chimney full of shavings and dry stuff,
and kindled it at top. When it had burned
down into the body of the kiln, and the whole
mass of wood was hot and fairly on fire, they put
turf on top, and made all tight, the air-holes at
the bottom affording just draught enough to
make the wood coal, without burning to ashes,
as it would in an open fire. By these air-holes
they could regulate the draught. If the wind
blew hard, and the draught was too great, stop
them up on the windward side; if too weak, open
them.</p>

<p>Boys will have fun out of anything. One
wouldn’t think there was a great deal of fun
in watching a coal-kiln night and day, so as to
be ready to fling on earth, or put on turf, if the
fire should burst out anywhere; but they had lots
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
of fun out of it, and the best times imaginable.
They built a camp, made it rain-proof by putting a
board roof on it, built a chimney of stones, where
they could cook in rainy weather, though in fair
weather they always built their fire before the
door of the camp, hunter fashion. They loved to
see the stars, the fire flashing through the trees;
and somehow things tasted sweeter when the
kettle hung by the crotch out of doors. The care
of the coal-kiln did not occupy much of their
time; but one of them was always obliged to be
there, in the event of the fire breaking out. Thus,
while one kiln was burning, they cut the wood for
another. Rare times they had of it in the evening!
They roasted coons, that could always be
found round the edge of the corn, clams, and ears
of corn, baked potatoes, and had all the maple
sugar they wanted, roasted eggs, and sometimes a
chicken. Neither did they lack for company.
Charlie, Uncle Isaac, and Joe were pretty sure to
be there every night. Sometimes Sally would take
her knitting-work and come up; and it was by no
means rare for all on the island, except the baby
and whoever had the care of him, to come; and
there was not a happier visitor at the camp than
Tige Rhines, who insisted on coming to the island
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
with John, and could not be persuaded to return
without him, although Captain Rhines, who was a
frequent visitor to the island, used all the arts of
persuasion he was master of to engage him to
return with him.</p>

<p>It is no marvel the coal-kiln was a popular resort.
The captain never failed, when he came on,
to bring apples, pears, plums, and a jug of new
cider to John. He was by no means chary of his
treasures; and it was quite agreeable to tired men
to sit around a blazing fire, eat apples and pears,
perhaps a piece of baked coon, with a roast potato,
drink a mug of sweet cider, and tell, or listen to, a
good story.</p>

<p>Upon such occasions Joe Griffin generally kept
the company in good humor. Ricker, who had
now become a universal favorite, contributed a
song. The change in this man was most remarkable.
From being a bully and a brag, he had
become a most agreeable, pleasant companion.
He had also manifested a great capacity for
handling tools; since latterly, the four men having
sawed out all the plank that was needed for
present use, Charlie had taken him and Thorndike
from the saw-pit, and set them at work on the
vessel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>“The best thing that ever happened to me,”
said he to Uncle Isaac, “was when I fell into the
hands of Lion Ben. Before that, I thought there
was nobody could handle me, and the idea came
near ruining me. I left off work, thought of
nothing but wrestling; was running to every
launching, raising, hauling, muster, and log-rolling
I could hear of, and was straining myself all to
pieces.”</p>

<p>“I,” replied Uncle Isaac, “used to wrestle a
good deal in my young days, and I know that in
some of those scrapes I have injured and worn
myself out more than I have in a year’s work;
yes, more than in two.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you have. I wrestled once, at North
Yarmouth, till the blood spun from my nose
a stream, and I was as sore the next day as
though I had been pounded with an ox-goad.
Then I was always treating and being treated, and
got so I couldn’t settle myself to work; and liquor
was fast getting the upper hands of me; but after
I went home from here, I thought of Mr. Rhines’s
advice, and determined to follow it. I never was
among such people as the folks are here. They
don’t drink as they do up our way,&mdash;at least those
that I’ve seen and worked with,&mdash;and are just
like brothers.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>“There’s plenty of drinking here, but you have
been among those who have seen the evil of it,
and left it off. There’s not a man you work with,
myself included, but, three years ago, drank spirit.
Now we think we’ve found a better way, one that
is more pleasant, better for the pocket, the health,
and the conscience.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a better way, and I’m going to join you,
and do as you do.”</p>

<p>“You are a young man, Mr. Ricker. Have you
any parents depending on you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. My parents both died when I was a
child. My father was killed by a falling tree.
My mother took sick and died, and my uncle
brought me up.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, just stay here amongst us. There
is plenty of work to do round here&mdash;chopping,
logging, and river-driving. There will be more
vessels built here, too. I don’t know whether
Charlie will work much longer or not; but if he
don’t, I will give you and Thorndike work all
winter, logging and making shingles; and when
you are not at work, you’re welcome to make my
house your home.”</p>

<p>“I’m very much obliged to you, Mr. Murch, and
shall be right glad, if Master Bell don’t work, to
take up with your offer.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<p>“There’s plenty of land here, that can be bought
cheap&mdash;good land, too; and there’s plenty of nice
young women, that know how to spin and weave,
and would make a striving man a good wife, take
care of whatever he brings into the house; and,
though I say it myself, there’s not a more industrious,
neighborly set of people in the United
States of America than live in this town; and you
travel the country through, and you won’t find a
better principled, more enterprising set of young
men; and I mean to do what little I can to encourage
them, and there’s others feel just as
I do.”</p>

<p>“I mean to be governed by your counsel, Uncle
Isaac. But, to tell the truth, there’s a young
woman up our way that I’ve had some dealings
with, and we were engaged once; but she didn’t
like my drinking, wrestling, and carousing about,
and neglecting my work, and her folks set in, and
that made a coldness between us. I love her as
the apple of my eye, and I drank more to drown
trouble.”</p>

<p>“You ought to think the more of her for not
approving of your drinking and idleness.”</p>

<p>“So I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, all you have to do is, just to go on as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
you are now doing, stay here out of the way of
temptation, and build up a good reputation. The
news won’t be long getting back to your place.
They’ll miss you at musters and raisings, and begin
to inquire, ‘Where’s Ricker? We want him to
take hold of this man that’s throwing everybody.’
The answer will come back, ‘Ricker’s given up
drinking and wrestling, and is at work on Elm
Island, having the best of wages. People there
think everything of him, and won’t let him go.
He’s going to buy a farm, and live among them.’
Take my word for it, the young woman will be the
first one to hear of it; and in time matters will
right themselves.”</p>

<p>The first kiln that John and Henry burned contained
forty bushels; the next, eighty. They
burned one more, drew the kilns, and put the
coals in a pen in one corner of the shop.</p>

<p>Captain Rhines came over to see how matters
progressed, and spent the night. In the evening
Charlie and John held a consultation in respect to
iron, which would soon be wanted, and fixtures for
the blacksmith’s shop.</p>

<p>“We can get along,” said John, “with an anvil,
bellows, two pairs of tongs, hand hammers, sledges,
and cold chisels.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>“Won’t you need a vice?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“It would be handy; but there won’t be any
screws to cut. I can get along without it.”</p>

<p>“What do these things cost?”</p>

<p>“An anvil will cost about fifteen dollars, a pair
of bellows about thirteen, and a good vice about
twenty-five.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good deal of money, just for tools,
when we’ve got so little. We must pinch all we
can on the hull, in order to be able to obtain the
sails and rigging. That will be a heavy bill, and
must be all cash.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I can do without a vice, make the
hammers, tongs, and other tools, and I think I can
make the bellows; so there will be only the anvil,
the steel, and iron to buy.”</p>

<p>Captain Rhines sat and listened, as they were
talking in low tones in a corner, till he could bear
it no longer; and taking Ben and Uncle Isaac
aside, he told them what he had overheard.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, Ben, to let such boys as these
struggle along so! I’ll take the Perseverance,
go to Portland or Boston, and buy them a complete
set of blacksmith’s tools. If we build vessels,
we shall want them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it, Benjamin,” said Uncle Isaac;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
“for the life of you, don’t you do it! You’ll do
them more hurt than good. Hardship don’t hurt
boys. It didn’t you and I. They are doing first
rate&mdash;making grand calculations! It’s drawing
out what’s in ’em. If James Welch had been
put to it as they are, it would have been better for
him, and saved his parents much misery.”</p>

<p>Ben siding with Uncle Isaac, the captain relinquished
his purpose.</p>

<p>Perhaps most of our young readers have seen a
pair of house bellows,&mdash;some have not,&mdash;stoves
and coal fires having consigned them, for the most
part, to oblivion; but they were a great institution
once&mdash;from the homely kitchen to the highly-ornamented
and gilded parlor ones.</p>

<p>Those boys who have not seen them can ask
their grandmothers, which will save us some detail;
and, as we have so many “last things” to say
to you in this volume, it is quite an object.</p>

<p>A blacksmith’s bellows is double. The wood is
six feet long, three feet four inches wide. Instead
of having merely top and bottom of wood, they
consist of three pieces of plank, and are double,
having two clappers. The upper piece is solid;
the middle piece has a hole and a clapper; the
bottom, another hole with a clapper. The top and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
bottom covers rise and fall by means of hinges at
the end. The middle piece is permanent, and the
bellows are hung in a frame by iron gimbals driven
into the edge of the middle piece. They are
worked by a long lever attached to the handle of
the bottom board, the space between the boards
being leather, which is distended by bows to prevent
its collapsing too much when empty. The
smith puts weights on the top plank to press it
down, and force the air into the fire, and hangs
another on the handle of the lower one to bring it
down, and open the bellows to admit air. He lifts
the lever, the bellows fill through the bottom.
The moment he brings it down, the air is forced
into the fire, and the upper portion of the bellows,
where it is retained by the upper clapper. When
the lever is raised again to refill, the weights on the
upper cover are still pressing the air into the fire.
Thus it is a draught all the time.</p>

<p>They made their covers, middle piece, and
clappers, hung them with leather hinges, made
the bows of ash, and in default of leather, covered
them with new canvas, that was left from the sails
of the Ark, closing the seams with pitch,&mdash;which
they procured from the woods,&mdash;mixed with charcoal
dust.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>They found an old bolt, cut it in two on the
edge of an old axe, made a fire heat, and pointed
the ends on a stone for an anvil, and made gimbals
to drive into the middle piece to hang their
machine.</p>

<p>“What under heavens shall we make a nose
of?” said John. “That beats me! If I had iron,
I could make it; but there’s not a scrap more on
the island.”</p>

<p>The nose of a blacksmith’s bellows is tunnel-shaped,
and at the extremity enters an iron tube,
called a tewel, which goes into the forge, and lies
just under the fire.</p>

<p>“We could make the tewel out of a gun
barrel. I’ve got an old Queen’s arm, at home,
that’s spoilt.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but what shall we make the nose of?
That must be broad-mouthed, and twice as big.”</p>

<p>“Make it of clay, and burn it in the fire.”</p>

<p>“It would be breaking. The heat would crack
it; and I don’t know how we could fay it to the
wood to make it tight.”</p>

<p>“Then make it of a piece of wood that has
been soaking in salt water. It will be some way
from the fire. We can keep watch of it, and wet
it with a mop.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe but we shall have to.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask your brother Ben, or Uncle
Isaac?”</p>

<p>“Let us make the frame to hang it on. Perhaps
we shall think of something.”</p>

<p>Before they had finished the frame, John exclaimed,
“I’ve got it, Hen! Just the thing! I’ve
seen an old blunderbuss barrel, without any stock
to it, kicking round Uncle Isaac’s shop. It will
make nose and tewel, both in one. I know he’ll
give it to me. ‘The lame and the lazy are always
provided for.’”</p>

<p>“What is a blunderbuss?”</p>

<p>“A short gun, bell-muzzled, and with an everlasting
great bore, made to fire a whole handful of
slugs and balls. They don’t use them now.”</p>

<p>“Go ask Uncle Isaac. Then take the boat, and
go after it. As you come along, stop into Peter
Brock’s shop, ask him to put it into his vice, and
start the breech-pin for me.”</p>

<p>When they had obtained the old gun barrel,
they completed their bellows, made a forge and
forge-trough. They had no chimney&mdash;the gas
went out through a hole in the roof.</p>

<p>John put some coal on the forge, kindled the
fire, and started the bellows. They worked capitally.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>“Hen,” said John, in high spirits, “that is what
I call ‘raising the wind’ in more ways than one.
We were only two days making these bellows, and
one of them was a rainy day. That’s pretty good
wages&mdash;six dollars and fifty cents per day!”</p>

<p>John and Henry now took the Perseverance,
and went to Portland. John went directly to Mr.
Starrett, who received him most cordially. He
told him all the circumstances from beginning to
end, upon which Mr. Starrett lent him an anvil
that was rather small for his heavy work, and told
him that Captain Pote had just got home from
the West Indies, and brought a lot of old iron
that he had bought there for little or nothing,
and would sell for one fourth the price he would
have to give at the warehouse. Probably he could
pick out a great deal that would answer his purpose;
that it lay on the wharf just as it was
thrown out of the vessel.</p>

<p>John and Henry went to the wharf, and spent
the whole day picking over the heap. They found
cold chisels, punches, sledges, hand hammers,
spikes, and ship’s bolts; eye bolts, ring bolts, studding-sail
boom irons, straps for mast circles and
caps.</p>

<p>John bought what he thought would answer his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
purpose, and threw it into the schooner. Mr.
Starrett bought the rest of his iron for him
cheaper than he could have bought it himself,
because he knew just what description and quantity
of metal were wanted. When it was all on
board the vessel, Mr. Starrett came and looked
it over.</p>

<p>“John,” said he, “you will make a great saving
by buying that old iron. With very little labor,
you will get the larger part of your fastening out
of it, a good deal of iron-work for the spars, and
all your thimbles. My boy, you will have a hard
job with so few tools, to do what you’ve got before
you; but you’ll win through it. If you have to
hang up, and go to work to raise money, come to
me. I’ll find you work.”</p>

<p>John thanked his friend, and they separated.
He arrived home, got his iron into the shop, his
anvil on the block, his tongs made, handles in the
hammers and sledges two days before the carpenters
put the keel together and wanted to bolt it.
He had no tool to head spikes; so he just turned
them over the anvil, making a head on one side,
like a railroad spike. They looked queer, but answered
the purpose just as well. Persons do not
know what they can do till they are compelled to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
exert their faculties to the utmost. It was this
rude training in the school of stern necessity that
has made this nation what it is.</p>

<p>We are to-day reaping the benefits of their
trials, and shall continue thus to do, if we do not,
by prosperity, become effeminate. The Pilgrims
suffered terribly the first winter, because they came
fresh from the homes of Old England, with the
habits of that country, and were comparatively
helpless. But suppose their children, born and
reared in this country, had been placed in just the
same circumstances, or a band of western hoosiers,
how soon would they have built up log shanties,
found clams and lobsters on the beach, fish under
the ice, coons and bears in their dens, and when
the spring opened, planted corn on a burn? The
Pilgrims had been reared among conveniences,
never been drawn out by necessity in that direction,
and most of them died in the seasoning,
being too old to learn.</p>

<p>But we see how Charlie conforms to the necessities
of his position. Once put on the track, and
encouraged by Ben and Uncle Isaac, he seems not
one whit inferior to John Rhines in contrivance
or resources to meet exigencies as they come
along.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>Charlie finished planking up the last day of December,
and discharged all his men, except Ricker.
Planking up a vessel was slow, hard work in those
days, as they had none of the modern appliances
to bring their plank to the timber, and nothing
better to bore the innumerable holes through the
hard timber than an old-fashioned pod augur, which
must be started in a hole cut with a gouge. They
bored from inside outward, because, the augur
being destitute of a screw, it was easier.</p>

<p>There was no blacksmith work of any amount to
be done till the carpenters began to work in the
spring.</p>

<p>Henry Griffin went to work with Ricker in the
barn, sawing out ceiling plank and other stuff.
Charlie and John burnt coal enough to finish the
iron-work, cut the small spars, and hauled them
out. The mast and main boom were so large that
Charlie was afraid to fall them till the snow was
deeper, for fear of breaking or injuring them; however,
as he knew the size of the spars, he made the
caps, and John ironed them, after which he learned
to saw with a whip-saw: this liberated Ricker, who
was a most excellent broadaxe-man, having been
accustomed all his life to hewing timber. Charlie
set him at work upon the spars, while he himself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
having plenty of seasoned stuff, built a long-boat
and yawl-boat for the vessel. In this way he could
employ the two men, John, and himself profitably:
the wages were less in the winter; the weather did
not interfere with the sawing, which was done
under cover. Ricker, indeed, worked under cover
in the shop with Charlie, when it was stormy or
severely cold, and helped him on the boats and the
windlass.</p>

<p>Charlie built a beautiful yawl-boat, putting in
gratings at the bow and in the bottom, with a fancy
yoke of mahogany, using up the last of his West
India wood in the operation, and in sheaves for
the blocks. When she was done, he painted her
handsomely.</p>

<p>“There,” said he; “they may laugh at the sloop,
but I reckon they won’t at the boat. Isaac shall
go ashore in as good shape as the best of them.”</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac had a lathe, and Charlie engaged
him to make the blocks and turn the sheaves in
the course of the winter.</p>

<p>They next made the rudder. Nowadays, when
vessels are steered with wheels, the tillers are a
straight stick of timber; but an old-fashioned one
required a stick of very peculiar form, something
the shape of the letter S; and what made it more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
difficult to get them, was the fact that a great
strain came on them, and they must be of tough
wood. Joe Griffin had engaged to hunt up a stick
in the woods, rough-hew it, and bring it to the
island.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>SALLY COMES TO THE RESCUE.</small></h2>

<p>Time now passed very pleasantly; there was a
smaller family; they were not exposed to the
weather, and in the evenings enjoyed themselves
very much. Charlie employed himself in the study
of surveying, and was more or less occupied in
making models of imaginary vessels and boats,
poring over an old English work on the sparring
of vessels, which he had borrowed of Mr. Foss.
At that day labor was not divided, as it is now;
carpenters were both spar-makers and joiners, bored
all the holes, and put in the fastening, the blacksmith
only riveting the bolts.</p>

<p>John occupied himself in contriving how to
economize his iron to the greatest possible extent,
and in what method, with the means and appliances
at his disposal, he should make the rudder-irons,
which, for a vessel of the size of the sloop, was a
heavy, difficult job. There was a great deal more
hard sledging connected with blacksmith work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
then than at present. The smith can now purchase
iron of almost any size and shape he wants; at that
time there was no round iron, and the iron for
small work must be drawn, or split up from large,
square bars; it was this that made the old iron
peculiarly valuable to John; it was of the right
size, as the greater part of it had come out of old
vessels; he found a great many bolts that only
needed straightening, or a piece cut off the end.</p>

<p>One evening Charlie was studying, Ben reading
a newspaper, Ricker asleep in his chair, and Hen
Griffin making a windmill for Ben, Jr. John had
been sitting for half an hour on a block in the
chimney corner, the tongs in his hands, with which
he took up little pieces of coal and squat them,
without uttering a word. At length he flung
down the tongs, and, jumping upright, cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ben! Ben! look here!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m looking straight at you.”</p>

<p>“You know we are going to be desperately put
to it to raise money enough to buy sails and rigging,
and are pinching all we dare to on the hull
and fastening on that account.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You know how they make booms in a river to
hold logs; they take long sticks, and fasten them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
together with iron, and sometimes with withes and
ropes, and they hold acres of logs against the whole
force of the freshet; and don’t you know what a
master-strain spruce poles, not more than six inches
through, will bear&mdash;how they will buckle before
they’ll break?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what’s the reason we couldn’t make
wooden shrouds by bolting some tough spars to
the mast-head and wales, and save shrouds and
chain-plates, which would be a <i>tremendous</i> saving.”</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be any give to them: when the
mast sprung, it would bring all the strain on the
poles, and carry them away.”</p>

<p>“But,” asked Henry, “why couldn’t you put a
dead-eye to the lower end, set it up with a lanyard,
just like any rigging? Then there would be spring
enough; or, if you didn’t like to bolt to the masthead,
put rope at both ends: you would <i>then</i> save
a good deal. I’m sure there would be no danger
of losing the spars by the stretching of the rigging.”</p>

<p>“They would be strong to bear an up-and-down
strain, as strong as rope, but would be liable to be
broken by anything striking them, when set up
taut: suppose the boom should happen to strike
them, or the yards, anchor-stock, or jib-boom of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
another vessel hauling by in the dock? They
wouldn’t stand anything of that kind, like rigging.”</p>

<p>“You say she’s going to carry a topsail and top-gallant-sail;
the topmast backstays would protect
them from the boom; and as for the rest, you could
carry spare ones in case of accident.”</p>

<p>“That might do; but wouldn’t the straps of your
dead-eyes split the end of the stick?”</p>

<p>“Treenail it.”</p>

<p>“Where could you get spars long enough, without
having them two thirds as large as the mast?”</p>

<p>“Make them in pieces,” said Charlie. “Split up
a large tree with the whip-saw: I can find a big
ash that will make four, or a spruce or yellow
birch.”</p>

<p>“Well, you <i>can</i> do it; but I should prefer rope.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, father; but if we are hard up, put
right up snug to it, we’ll do it, sure.”</p>

<p>When, afterwards, Ben told his father of this
novel method of economy, the captain laughed till
the tears ran down his cheeks.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said he, “what they won’t think of
next. I always thought myself indifferently good
for contrivance; but they go ahead of me.”</p>

<p>“They’ve made first-rate calculations, thus far,
in everything.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>“I guess Isaac was right: he said difficulty would
spur ’em up, and draw ’em out. I should think
it was doing it, if it has drawn that out of ’em.”</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on, Sally was
sewing with all her might, improving the moments
while the children were asleep: she had, nevertheless,
been an attentive listener. At length, laying
down her work, she said, “Charlie, I don’t suppose
you would think very highly of any advice or
opinion coming from a woman in regard to these
affairs.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I would, mother; I would think a great
deal of your opinion about anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I think I can help you about your
sails.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i>, mother!” cried Charlie, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, me. I think that I, and other women that
I can find could weave the <i>greater</i> part, if not the
whole, of the duck for your sails, if we could get
the flax, and a good deal cheaper than you can
buy it: perhaps it wouldn’t look so well, but I’ll be
bound ’twould wear as well.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done it now, Sally,” said Ben. “That
is the most sensible plan for saving I’ve heard yet.
But do you know what an undertaking you’ve laid
out for yourself? Why, there’ll be over seven
hundred yards of cloth in the mainsail alone.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>“Did you ever know me set out to do anything
I didn’t accomplish?”</p>

<p>“No; except this.”</p>

<p>“I shall accomplish this.”</p>

<p>“But,” said John, quite bewildered, “I didn’t
know canvas was made in looms, like other cloth.”</p>

<p>“All cloth is made in looms.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I didn’t think sail-cloth was made in
such looms as yours.”</p>

<p>“In England,” said Ben, “all the sail-cloth for
their merchant and naval service is wove in such
looms, as no English vessel is allowed to wear any
other. If we were under England, as we were a
few years ago, Sally couldn’t make this cloth if she
wanted to; it would have to be made there; but
they import the hemp and linen yarn from Russia
and other places. It used to be all spun by hand,
on a little wheel; but I understand of late they’ve
got mills to go by water that spin.”</p>

<p>“But I shouldn’t think a woman could weave
such heavy stuff.”</p>

<p>“Can’t they?” said Sally, going to a drawer, and
taking out a piece of bed-tick that she had woven
with four treadles, and beat up thick. “What do you
think of that? Would any wind get through that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll give up now; but still, I don’t see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
how so much cloth as they use in England, and
send over here, and, I suppose, everywhere else,
<i>can</i> be made in such a small way.”</p>

<p>But this, which was entirely new to John, excited
his wonder, and was so difficult of belief, was
no matter of surprise to Charlie.</p>

<p>“<i>Small way!</i>” he exclaimed: “a good many
strands make a rope. O, you don’t know much
about England. Why, the people there are thicker
than flies around a dead herring, glad to turn their
hand to anything to get their bread, and thousands
can’t get it; not because they are too lazy to work,
but can’t get the work to do, are helped by the
parish, and often die of hunger.”</p>

<p>“<i>Die of hunger!</i> That’s awful.”</p>

<p>“No more awful than true, though. There are
whole villages in England&mdash;and I’ve heard my
father say it’s just so in Ireland and Scotland&mdash;where,
from year’s end to year’s end, all that the
greater part of the people do is to raise, spin, and
weave flax; those that are able to, hire land; but
the poor, that can’t hire land, why, the merchants
find the yarn, and give them so much a yard to
weave it; and old people, seventy and eighty years
old, that can’t do anything else, will do a little
something at that; an old wife, that can’t get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
across the floor without her crutch, and her head
as white as a sheet, will sit in the corner and croon
a song, because hunger drives her to it: men and
women weave the year round.”</p>

<p>“<i>Men weave?</i>”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; hundreds and thousands of them
never do anything else all their lives&mdash;<i>couldn’t</i> do
anything else.”</p>

<p>“I declare! a man weaving, sitting down behind
a loom, doing women’s work!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sitting down behind a loom; and thank
God for the privilege.”</p>

<p>“I guess they would keep me there a good
while. I’d put on a petticoat, and take a dish-cloth
in my hand, and done with it. Only think of Joe
Griffin, Uncle Isaac, and our Ben weaving!”</p>

<p>“It is so there; and you go to one of their
houses, knock at the door, and a man will come
to open it, with his beard stuck full of thrums and
lint.”</p>

<p>“So you see, John,” said Sally, “where sail-cloth
comes from. You know old Mr. Blaisdell?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He was a weaver before he came to this country;
and they say sometimes, of a rainy day, when
his son’s wife has a piece in the loom, he’ll get in
and weave like everything.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>“But, mother, the vessel would rot on the stocks
before you could spin and weave cloth enough for
her sails: besides, where could you get the flax?”</p>

<p>“I’ve planned it all out; for I’ve been thinking
of it ever since you set out to build the vessel, and
will have the sails done before you do the hull, I
can tell you.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know how,” said her husband.</p>

<p>“I’m going to begin right off, while my family is
small. I want Charlie to go over to Fred in the
morning, and tell him to buy all the flax and linen
yarn he can get; he can pay in goods, or half
goods and half money, and that will help him; the
yarn will do for the light sails: what we spin,
we’ll spin a coarser thread, for the larger sails.
Fred can send potash to Boston, and buy the flax.
I think there’s flax enough round here: if not,
there is in Boston; it is not long since a vessel-load
of it was sent from there to Ireland. I’ll risk
Fred for getting flax.”</p>

<p>“So will I,” said Charlie; “because he don’t
have any opportunity to turn in his work, as John
and I do, and will jump at the chance.”</p>

<p>“But the spinning and weaving!” said Ben.</p>

<p>“There’s Sally Griffin&mdash;she’s only Joe and herself
to take care of; last time I saw her, she told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
me they had only one cow; that she hadn’t half
enough to do: she’ll weave a lot, and spin, too; so
will Hannah Murch, and they’ve got the flax; so
will my mother, and our Jane, Mary Rhines and
Elizabeth. There’s Danforth Eaton’s wife hasn’t
chick nor child in the world, and old Mrs. Smullen’s
a capital spinner, and Mr. Blaisdell, a born
weaver, who never did anything else till he came
to this country, is getting rather old for hard work;
his wife, too, and his son’s wife and daughters, are
weavers. I know as well as I want to that he
wouldn’t like anything better than to weave till
spring work comes on, and every rainy day after;
then there’s the three Godsoe girls and their
mother, living with their brother Jacob; the girls
take in weaving, and the old lady can spin; there
won’t be much spinning; we can buy most of the
yarn. When we begin to build, I will hire two
girls, and one of them can weave most of the time
in the corn-house. I know of lots more I can find.
I’m going over with Charlie in the morning, and
get Hannah Murch to help me hunt them up, and
then give it all into the hands of Fred: there will
be no trouble; everybody will be for it, because
they see we are trying to start something to help
the place. Just calculate for yourself: there’s more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
than a year to do it in; of that coarse cloth, a person
would weave twelve yards in a day&mdash;three
hundred and twelve yards a month, at least. Old
Mr. Blaisdell alone would weave your mainsail in
two months, or less; for he would weave fourteen
yards a day. I have reckoned up seventeen now,
and can find fifty. Now what do you think, Ben?”</p>

<p>“I think you’ll do it; for if you, Hannah Murch,
and Uncle Isaac get together, you’ll set the town
on fire.”</p>

<p>“O, mother,” cried Charlie, “you are the best
woman that ever was, or ever will be. Now,
mother, you didn’t think, when I told you that
night at milking that there would be a vessel built
here before five years, there would be one built
before your own door in two, and you would make
her sails.”</p>

<p>“But you remember I told you, when it <i>did</i>
come to pass, I would send a venture in her: I’ve
got lots of hens, and I want some money to buy
an eight-day brass clock with, that shows the
changes of the moon.”</p>

<p>“O, mother, we’ll raise lots of hens, and you
shall have all the room in the vessel you want.”</p>

<p>The next morning Sally went round among her
old friends and school-mates, who received her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
with open arms, and entered heart and soul into
her plan. Uncle Blaisdell was delighted, and told
Sally he would oversee the whole work.</p>

<p>“If you had all the canvas these old fingers
have wove,” said he, “it would make sails for a
good many such vessels.”</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Yelf, contrary to all expectations, had
recovered: Sally found her sitting by the fire, and
she was greatly interested.</p>

<p>“Sally, tell Fred to bring me the yarn. I’ll
weave enough for a small sail, if I die for’t. I
shall glory in it, and an old lady’s blessing shall
go with it. They’re good boys; they have begun
right; they’ve sought the Lord in their youthful
days, and to whatever they set their hands they’ll
prosper.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got the sails under way,” said Charlie,
“and got our iron: we shall want a good deal of
tar, for she must have a brimstone bottom, or the
worms will eat her all up in two months at the
West Indies.”</p>

<p>“We can make that,” said John.</p>

<p>“Make tar?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed: cut down pine trees, take the
limbs where we have cut timber and knees, and
make a tar-pit. I know all about that.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>CHARLIE’S THEODOLITE.</small></h2>

<p>It was now the latter part of winter; the snow
was deep; Charlie began to think about cutting
his mast, main boom, and bowsprit. He did not at
first contemplate having anything above the top-gallant
sail; but when Sally came home and related
her conversation with Mrs. Yelf, Ben said,
“Charlie you must gratify the old lady; it would
be bad luck and a sin not to do so.”</p>

<p>“But, father, there is no sail that she could
weave cloth enough for.”</p>

<p>“Well, then you must have one on purpose for
her; have a flying royal; there will be no braces,
the sheets will make fast to the top-gallant yard,
it will furl right in with the top-gallant sail, the
yard will be underneath the top-gallant stay and
when the yard hoists up, the stay will go with it;
it will be a little thing, not more than forty or forty-five
yards: she can do that well enough.”</p>

<p>The lower mast was no less than twenty-eight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
inches in diameter when made, and eighty feet
long. This required a tree of great size; there
was no such one left in the lot from which the
boys were to cut their timber, and they were
obliged to buy one. The bowsprit, which was
shorter, and the boom, which, though seventy-five
feet in length, was much smaller, they could obtain
on their own lot. There were trees enough on the
island of much larger size; but those enormous
trees, that would make a thirty-six inch mast for a
man-of-war Ben didn’t like to cut, now that the
pressure of poverty was removed.</p>

<p>It would have been a great deal of work for
Charlie to have gone on to his own land, broken
a road through the deep snow to the back end of
his lot to obtain it; then, to tow so large a stick six
miles would have been a great undertaking in the
winter time.</p>

<p>“Charlie,” said Ben, “there’s a tree stands a
couple of rods to the north-east of the big pine that
has the eagle’s nest on it, large enough to make
your mast. There’s a short crook in it near the
top; if it is long enough below that, I will sell it to
you cheap, because the crook spoils it for a mast
for a ship of the line, though it is large enough
otherwise: let us go and look at it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>When they came to view it, Ricker, who was a
man of great experience in the woods, thought it
was long enough; Ben thought it was not; Charlie
didn’t presume to give an opinion, but his
knowledge of surveying helped him out of the
difficulty. “I’ll measure it,” he said.</p>

<p>“You can’t climb it,” said Ben, “and there’s no
scrubby tree to fall on to it, to climb: how are you
going to measure it?”</p>

<p>The ground around was level; Charlie made a
mark on the tree where it was to be cut off, then
measured a distance from it equal to the length
of his mast, and drove down a stake; then cut two
straight ash sprouts, one two feet, the other one
foot long, found the middle of the longest, made a
hole in it with the point of his jackknife, whittled
the end of the short one to a wedge, and stuck it
into it. He now got down on his hands and knees
at the stake, held the short stick as nearly level
with the mark on the butt of the tree as possible,
then sighted over the ends of the two sticks; his
eye struck the tree a short distance below the
crook.</p>

<p>“It’s a snug rub, but I guess ’twill go; cut it
down. I’ll risk it.”</p>

<p>Ricker and John soon brought the great tree to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the ground, when it was found to be seven inches
longer than required. These two ash sprouts were
Charlie’s theodolite, and answered his purpose as
well as one that would cost two hundred dollars.</p>

<p>“Well done, my boy,” said Ben, who had watched
the operation with great interest. “That’s a capital
application of the principle that the two sides of a
right-angled triangle are equal.”</p>

<p>“I could have hit it exactly if I had brought a
plumb line, to have taken a true level of the base.”</p>

<p>The reason that Charlie made the perpendicular
stick longer than the other was, that he might get
his eye down to sight at the trunk of the tree;
otherwise he must have dug a hole in the ground.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>HARD-SCRABBLE.</small></h2>

<p>In a few days after the occurrences related in
the previous chapter, Peterson came to Captain
Rhines, declaring that he could by no means consent
to be passed by in the sail-making; that no
one in the place felt more interest in his young
captain than himself; for had he not taught him
seamanship? and that his old woman could weave
with the best of them.</p>

<p>“Indeed, James,” said the captain, “Luce shall
have all the cloth to weave that she wants; you
shall help make the sails and rig, and we reckon
upon you to calk her.”</p>

<p>Charlie continued to work with his small crew
till the first of May, when, the days being long and
the weather warm, he recalled his hands, and the
work went on apace. Not having conveniences,
as at present, to bring the plank to the timbers,
when they came to bend the ceiling-plank at the
bow and stern, they spiked two pieces of plank
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
across the butts of a couple of elms that grew side
by side; then taking the plank hot from the steam-box,
they put the end of it under one plank and
over the others. Four or five men then took hold
of it, while Charlie struck on it with the edge of
his broadaxe, whang! when the men would bear
down, and bend the plank, then he would strike in
another place. This was to make it bend by cutting
it part way off, just as joiners sometimes saw
scarfs in a board when they want it to bend, as in
building a front-yard fence at the corner of a street,
only the joiner saws on the inside, and, when he
bends his board, the scarf closes up; whereas, they
cut on the outside, and when the plank was brought
to, the cuts gaped, and the plank was no stronger
for the wood between.</p>

<p>They did not make any tar. Fred contrived a
method to obtain it much cheaper than they could
have made it, and leave a handsome profit for
himself&mdash;a twofold advantage, as he was obliged
to take the money expended on the vessel from his
business, which was a great detriment. He needed
every cent to buy goods, as his business was increasing,
and he would not buy on credit, although
Mr. Welch was ready to trust him.</p>

<p>But as the lack of means tended directly to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
develop the mechanical ability of John and Charlie,
by compelling contrivance and effort, thus did
it sharpen the wits of Fred. He bought potash
for half money, half goods; fish for all store pay,
or one fourth money, thus making a profit on his
goods; sent the potash and fish to Boston, sold
them for cash, and bought tow, cotton cloth, and
shoes, for negro clothing. He filled the Perseverance
up with these articles, and a cheaper
quality of fish; paid Ben out of his store for the
boat; went captain himself, with Peterson for
pilot and sailing-master, Sydney Chase and young
Peterson as crew; bartered his cargo in Carolina
for tar, pitch, turpentine, and corn, and came back
to Boston; sold part of the corn, and all the tar,
pitch, and turpentine he did not want for the vessel,
for cash, bought a stock of goods to bring home
with him, and ground the corn in his own mill.</p>

<p>“That,” said Captain Rhines, delighted, “is
what I call a calculation.”</p>

<p>The vessel was completed in August, and
launched the 29th of September, the very day
Charlie was twenty-one. In addition to building
the vessel, they had, in the mean time, cleared all
the growth from the land on which they cut their
timber, burnt over and fenced it for Ben; also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
helped him cut his hay and hoe his corn. Built
of pine, and now well seasoned, she was as light
on the water as a cork.</p>

<p>The whole town came to the launching, for all
were interested in her, even Parson Goodhue,
with his new hat and wig; but he kept a respectful
distance from the gander. There was
much diversity of opinion among the owners in
respect to a name. Some wanted to call her
Charlie Bell; but Charlie declared she looked too
bad to be named for anybody. Some wanted to
call her the Pioneer, others, Enterprise.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what to call her,” said Joe Griffin.
“You’ve had such a hard scratch to build her, and
ain’t done scratching yet, call her Hard-Scrabble.”</p>

<p>This was unanimously assented to. It had, indeed,
been a hard scrabble, and the conflict was by
no means ended. The boys feared the worst was
to come. She was to be fitted for sea.</p>

<p>Charlie was certainly right in saying that she
looked too bad to be named for anybody, though
it was allowed on all hands that she was an excellent
model, true in all her proportions, and not a
bunch or a slack place could be found anywhere.
Yet she was rough as rough could be. Even then
it was customary to plane the wales and bulwarks,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
and paint them black, with a turpentine streak,
and the spars were generally painted black. But
the wales of the Hard-Scrabble were just as the
adze left them, although with the narrow adze,
used in those days, the timber was left much
smoother than after the wider ones now in use.
The men were also skilful dubbers. The deck
beams, which are now planed and smoothed with
sand-paper, they left rough; but then they dubbed
them, without breaking their chip, the whole length
of the beam, leaving a succession of little ridges,
which were thought very fine; and there are not
many workmen at the present day can do that: as
for bulwarks, she had none.</p>

<p>Aft she had a high quarter-deck, about twenty
feet long, under which were the accommodations,
where a fireplace was built, the cooking done, and
all hands lived, the men being separated from the
officers by a bulkhead. When she was loaded,
this would be the only dry place in her, as the
lower deck would be at the water’s edge, perhaps
under water.</p>

<p>A pole, called a rough tree, was run along from
forward to aft, and fastened to stanchions to prevent
falling overboard. The top timbers, however,
came up all along, and there was a short rail at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
bows, and all along the quarter-deck; also some
heavy pieces of white oak, made to run across the
vessel in several places, with a mortise in the ends,
which slipped over the heads of the top timbers
above the deck load, giving great support to the
upper works, as the waist was deep. The deck
was as rough as it came from the saw; not a board
about the cabin, inside or out, was planed, except
where it was necessary to make a joint.</p>

<p>As Charlie had predicted, there was not a brushful
of paint on her, except that the name was put
on the bare white plank with lampblack and oil,
instead of chalk, as he thought would be the case.
Her wales looked the funniest. They could not
afford pitch to go all over her, so they only put it
on the seams; and, as the plank were not painted,
she looked queer enough with a white stripe and a
black one. They wanted to economize pitch for
the bottom, which must have a solid coat of pitch
and brimstone, to prevent the worms from eating
her up in the West Indies. Into this pitch they
put some of the yellow ochre, which the boys got
on their excursion to Indian camp-ground. The
knees were but half bolted; there was not a butt-bolt
in her; the butts were merely spiked; spruce
limbs took the place of bolts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>Captain Rhines said she would do well enough
to go one voyage or two, till she earned something,
and they could put in fastenings when they
were better able.</p>

<p>She had neither figure nor billet-head, only a
gammon knee. In short, with her handsome proportions
and fine model, she appeared like a well-built
man in most vile apparel.</p>

<p>The cloth for the sails now began to come in,
and the bolts were piled up in the corn-house. In
consequence of all this hard work, contrivance, and
pinching economy in every direction, she stood
them at the wharf, with her mast in and spars
made, twelve dollars per ton.</p>

<p>The canvas and remaining expense, which they
were now able to estimate, they found would be
about one thousand five hundred dollars. Their
money was nearly all expended; but they had paid
their bills as they went along, and the vessel was in
the water. They could now do but little more in
the way of saving, as they could not turn in their
own labor, but must have cash. They therefore
put their heads together to devise means for raising
it.</p>

<p>Captain Rhines and Ben both offered them the
money to fit her for sea; but, to their astonishment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
they refused it. The captain endeavored in vain
to prevail on them to permit him to lend them
the money.</p>

<p>“Just think of it, John! Here is this vessel lying
idle at the wharf, and you are losing the interest
of what she cost you, and it will be another
year before you can earn the money, and rig her.
Before that time, you might send her to the West
Indies, and make her pay for herself. Ben and I
will charter and load her the moment she’s ready
for sea; we’ll let Seth Warren take her, and go
out to the West Indies this winter.”</p>

<p>“But, father, the cloth for the sails ain’t made.”</p>

<p>“There’s enough done for the mainsail: you
wouldn’t want to go out there till the middle of
January, so as to come on the coast in good
weather; the cloth will be ready by that time.
Ben, Peterson, and I can go right to work on the
mainsail.”</p>

<p>“But we built her for Isaac; he owns a quarter
of her, and I shouldn’t like to have him come home
and find we had taken another into our concern,
and sent him off with his vessel; then, if the man
should have bad luck, he certainly wouldn’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go myself. I don’t think Isaac would
object to my having been in her, especially if he
found she had paid for herself.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Rhines made a sign to John to remain
firm; for of all things she dreaded, it was her husband’s
going to sea.</p>

<p>“Father,” said John, at length, “you are real
kind and good; but we solemnly agreed, when we
were all together, to build this vessel ourselves,
and not to run in debt. I can’t break that pledge,
especially in the absence of one of the contracting
parties. I don’t think it would be right.”</p>

<p>“No more it wouldn’t. I didn’t know that, but
thought it was only a boyish notion of yours.”</p>

<p>“If we are <i>losing</i> interest, we are not <i>paying</i>
interest: we don’t owe for her.”</p>

<p>It required more money to rig her, in proportion
to the cost of the hull, than it would in ordinary
cases, they had economized so much on the hull,
she being only half fastened, and no expense having
been laid out for finish or paint.</p>

<p>Fred calculated to raise his money by some
smart stroke in business: he had no other way.
John and Charlie had many plans under consideration.
Charlie could build boats, John could go to
work at Portland, or, as they wanted to be together,
Charlie could go to Stroudwater.</p>

<p>But it was now October. Isaac would be at
home in a year: they could not in that time earn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
money enough to fit her for sea, and they wanted
to be able to load her with lumber from Charlie’s
land, as Ben did the Ark.</p>

<p>After looking at the matter in every possible
light, and puzzling their heads to make something
out of nothing, this committee of ways and means
determined to go and consult with Uncle Isaac.</p>

<p>After stating the case fully to him, Charlie said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Suppose John goes to Portland, and I to
Stroudwater, to work, and while I’m gone this
winter, get Joe Griffin to cut the wood off of Indian
Island, and put it on the bank, send it to
Boston or Salem, that, with what we could both
earn, would, I think, with what we shall save by
having the canvas and sails made at home, fetch
us out. If I should ever go on my place to live, I
should want a sheep pasture; and that would make
a nice one if it was cleared. I could keep sheep
there: in the winter they could live on kelp, rock-weed,
and thatch round the shores, with a very
little hay, as father’s do on Griffin’s Island.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t want to do that: you’d have to give
Joe fifty cents for cutting and putting it on the
bank. It would bring nine shillings in Boston:
that wouldn’t leave you more than two hundred
and fifty dollars, at the outside.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>“Yes; but it’s going to take me almost a year
to earn that in a shipyard, and I can be earning
all the time while they are cutting the wood.”</p>

<p>“If you cut the wood off that island, which lies
right off the mouth of your harbor, and shelters it
from the winds, it will leave it much exposed. It
isn’t large enough to make much of a sheep pasture:
you can’t keep sheep there in winter; for,
besides there not being dulse, Irish moss, and kelp,
as there is on Griffin’s, and the outer islands, the
bay freezes in the winter, and the wolves would
go over on the ice and kill them. I wouldn’t cut
it off, and expose my harbor, for anything.”</p>

<p>“Potash brings cash: couldn’t I cut the white
oaks and rock maples at the shore, and make
potash?”</p>

<p>“What a way that would be!&mdash;to cut down
good ship timber and sugar trees, that would make
keels for ships, burn them up for potash, and that
is the end of it. If we get to building vessels
here, you will want it all for ship timber, because
it is right on the spot. Let the folks back in the
country, where ship timber isn’t worth anything,
burn it up for potash: that would be saving at the
tap and losing at the bunghole.”</p>

<p>“But I shall never build another vessel if I don’t
get this one done, and I want the money.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>“I see what you want,&mdash;to raise the money
quicker than you can earn it in the yard or shop,
and be together, too. You’d be willing to do almost
anything to bring that about.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, exactly, Uncle Isaac,” said John.</p>

<p>“Well, then, listen to me. You’ve got money
enough to buy the bolt-rope for your sails&mdash;haven’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, start right off for Portland and
Stroudwater as fast as you can go. Don’t lose a
minute. Send down the bolt-rope and twine for
Captain Rhines and Ben to make the sails with at
their leisure. Be back here by Christmas; and
you, Joe Griffin, and myself will go back to the
Canada line, spend the winter, and hunt bears,
beavers, otters, and moose. If we don’t get furs
enough to bring you out clear, and something
more, then my name ain’t Isaac Murch.”</p>

<p>The boys listened, with staring eyes and open
mouths, till he concluded, then making a rush, both
caught him round the neck.</p>

<p>“Just what we’ve always been longing to do!”
said Charlie. “Just what we’ve been talking,
dreaming about, and telling we meant to do
some time.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>The boy-nature, which had been in abeyance a
long time, and kept down by hard work and
anxiety, was all up now, fresh and blithe as
May.</p>

<p>“How glad I am we got stuck!” said Charlie.
“Now we’ll make money, and have a good time,
both together. O, I wish Fred could go!”</p>

<p>“But will Joe go?” asked John.</p>

<p>“Will he eat when he’s hungry? He’s almost
as well acquainted as I am. He’s been logging
and hunting up that way. He saw a hunter last
week, that came out of the woods because his
folks were sick. He’s a great friend of Joe’s, and
told him of places where the beavers are getting
ready to build their houses, and where the moose
are going to make a yard, and said, as he couldn’t
go into the woods this winter, he would lend him
his steel traps. I’ve got a few traps, and know
where I can hire a few more, and we must make
up the number we lack with dead-falls. I’ll make
snow-shoes for you and John, and arrange everything.
We can’t start without snow, and therefore
if there’s no snow when you come home, we
must wait till there is.”</p>

<p>“But,” asked John, “can’t we hunt round
here?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. Kill bears and wolves, and get
the bounty&mdash;anywhere within fifty miles.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said John, “we shan’t have to come
to the wooden shrouds, after all.”</p>

<p>“I hope we shan’t. I didn’t think we should,”
said Charlie.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the boys started off for Portland
in exuberant spirits, having first made an
arrangement with Fred that he should employ
Ricker and the Eatons to cut logs enough on
Charlie’s land to make one hundred and seventy-five
thousand of boards, begin to haul them to
the mill on the first snow, in order to have them
seasoning, to load the Hard-Scrabble.</p>

<p>“We thought Fred wouldn’t have so good a
chance as ourselves,” said Charlie, “because, not
being a carpenter nor blacksmith, he couldn’t turn
in his work, but he’s turned in his goods. He sent
those poor hake, that nobody here could eat, out
South to feed the negroes, and got pitch, turpentine,
and corn. He’ll pay for most of the flax,
and for the weaving, in goods. He’s taken a
good many orders since we’ve been building.
He’ll pay the Eatons for cutting and hauling the
timber, and the mill men for sawing, from the
store. He won’t get much out of Ricker only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
his tobacco; so I shouldn’t wonder if he didn’t
have to pay much money, after all.”</p>

<p>“I guess,” said John, “it will be you, and I, and
Isaac that will have to pay the money. His goods
will come to more than our labor.”

<small>PLEASURE AND PROFIT.</small></h2>

<p>It is the latter part of December, just before
sunset. The snow, which had fallen in successive
storms since the first of the month, now lay deep
on the ground. Making their way in Indian file
through the forest are four persons, in whom we
recognize Uncle Isaac, Joe Griffin, Charlie, and
John. They are each of them harnessed to a
singular sort of a vehicle, called in hunters’ phrase
“toboggin,” by long thongs of deer-skin, which
are put across the breast, and secured to the neck
by another strap to prevent their slipping down,
like the breastplate of a horse. The vehicle consists
of a cedar board, eight feet long and eighteen
inches wide, quarter of an inch thick, made perfectly
smooth, and the forward end bent up like
the nose of a sled, some bars put across to
strengthen it, to which to fasten the load. This
formed the lightest sled imaginable, being so long,
in proportion to its width, as to receive but little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
obstruction from the snow. The forward part,
bent up, glided easily over the drifts or logs, and it
was withal so thin, that it bent, and accommodated
itself to the inequalities of the surface. Upon the
sledges they carry their rifles, powder, balls, and
buckshot, steel-traps, blankets, and a small kettle,
pork, bread, and parched corn, a large file, whetstone,
axe, and other necessaries, including a frow
(a large knife) for splitting shingles. They wear
moccasons and snow-shoes; in their belts a knife
and hatchet. Each man also has a horn of tinder,
flint, steel, and brimstone matches.</p>

<p>The boys were, evidently weary with their unaccustomed
work, and Charlie cast many a furtive
glance towards the setting sun, the light of which
shone red through the trees. It was also evident
that even Joe was not unaffected by fatigue; but
upon the seasoned frame of Uncle Isaac the journey
apparently made no impression.</p>

<p>“There ought to be a brook somewhere about
here,” said he. “Ah! I see the place. It’s just
beyond that hemlock, though the water itself is all
covered with ice and snow. We’ll camp there.
We ought to have camped two hours ago, but I
wanted to reach this spot.”</p>

<p>This was the first experience of real camp and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
hunter’s life the boys had ever known. To be
sure they had camped out in summer, on Smutty
Nose and in other places; but now it was bitter
cold, and the snow two feet deep. They were
also tired. Uncle Isaac, taking counsel only of
his own toughened sinews, had not made sufficient
allowance for the little practice they had ever
known in snow-shoe walking. Their shoulders
ached with the cutting of the straps, and their
feet from the pressure of the snow-shoes. Their
loads, light at first, grew heavier every mile.</p>

<p>As they looked around upon the trees covered
with snow, their loads white with frost, realized
that they were in a wilderness, no house within
thirty miles, they began to feel that the hunting,
to which they had looked forward with such rapturous
anticipations, had its rough as well as its
romantic side. The place where they had halted
was in a heavy growth of hard wood, largely
mixed with hemlock, which, in the gathering
twilight of the short winter day, with their long
branches, gave a peculiar black and gloomy appearance
to the spot in the eyes of Charlie and
John; but not so with the others.</p>

<p>“What a glorious place for a camp!” said Joe,
going up to a large hemlock, which had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
turned up by the wind the year before, which
made, with its great roots matted together and
filled with frozen earth, an impenetrable barrier
against the north-west wind, blowing keen and
cold; “and here is something to warm us,” taking
his axe from the sled, and attacking with vigorous
blows a large beech, that stood with its dead, dry
branches extended to the wintry sky.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac and the boys now took off their
snow-shoes, and with them scraped off the snow
around the stump to the ground; then, cutting
some crotched poles, set them up in the snow, trod
it around to keep them steady, then putting other
poles into the crotches, rested their ends on the
top of the stump, thus forming rafters, and over
them threw brush, till they made it all tight, leaving
a hole in the centre for the smoke to go out;
then covered the floor thickly with hemlock
branches, and flung their blankets on it. By
this time Joe had the tree cut up. They first
carried the large logs into the camp, then brought
along the smaller limbs and dry twigs, adding
them to the pile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Uncle Isaac and John collected a
whole armful of birch bark from the trees, and
kindled it. In a moment the fire, catching the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
great mass of dry wood, streamed through the
hole in the top of the camp, and glancing upon
the dark masses of hemlocks, lit up the faces of
the group, as they stood around the fire, with a
ruddy glow, and changed the whole character of
the scene as by enchantment.</p>

<p>The next morning they broke camp, and travelled
till noon, camped, and rested during the
remainder of the day. Next morning, being refreshed
by rest, and well seasoned to their work,
they started before daylight, and travelled through
a dense forest till Saturday noon, when they came
to a place where fires had destroyed the growth
of trees many years before, and the land was overrun
with bushes, alternating with clear spots. Its
northern edge was broken into gentle hills and
vales.</p>

<p>While eating dinner, they espied some deer on
the side of one of the hills, browsing among the
young growth that had come up after the fire, and
scraping away the snow with their feet to get at
the dead grass.</p>

<p>A fresh breeze was blowing and roaring in the
tree tops, which would conceal the noise of their
approach. It was evident that the deer did not
see them, as they had not yet emerged from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
wood, and had instantly lain down on seeing the
deer. The wind was also blowing directly from
the animals, so that they could not scent them.</p>

<p>There were clumps of bushes, thickly matted,
with large open spaces between them. Those
nearest to the deer were within gunshot; but the
difficulty lay in crossing the open spaces, as they
would have to do so in sight of the herd. But Uncle
Isaac said if Charlie and John would remain
where they were, he and Joe would surprise them.</p>

<p>He then cut a parcel of pine boughs, and tied
them all around Joe’s head, Joe in turn doing the
same for him; so that when they got down on the
snow, which was hard enough to bear them, they,
at a distance, resembled a bush. Then they
crawled along, watching the deer, remaining
motionless when they saw them looking towards
them; but when they turned from them to feed,
crawled on till they reached a clump of bushes.
Charlie and John watched them with breathless
attention as they entered the last clump of bushes.
It seemed to them an age after they disappeared
from sight; still they heard nothing. The deer
now began to manifest distrust. The leader raised
his head and snuffed the air. The greater part of
them began to move their tails violently, and left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
off feeding. At that moment the report of the
rifles was heard, the leader fell down in his tracks,
and another, after two or three leaps, fell on his
knees, when Joe, rushing to his side, drew his
knife across his throat.</p>

<p>They were now highly elated, as they had provisions
enough for a long time. Hanging the carcasses
in trees, to prevent the wolves from getting
them, they pressed on, in order to reach a suitable
place to camp before night.</p>

<p>Long before dark, they arrived at a place pronounced
by Uncle Isaac to be just the thing: it
was a great precipice of rock, that rose, for the
most part, perpendicular to the height of twelve
or fifteen feet, but in one place jutted over very
much, forming quite a cave at its base, filled with
stones of no great size, that had fallen from the
precipice, and lay buried beneath the snow. They
cut a lot of dry and green limbs and bushes, and
threw into this cavity, and then set them on fire,
which melted all the snow, and warmed the whole
cliff. Then they rolled out the scattering rocks,
and had a floor on one side, and a roof overhead
of stone. They now cut some long poles, and
leaned them against the precipice, leaving a hole
for the smoke, and covered them with brush.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
There was a crack in the ledge, into which Uncle
Isaac drove a stake, and affixed a crotch to it, to
hang the kettles on. As the morrow was the Sabbath,
an extra quantity of wood was to be prepared;
the camp being so high and large, they put
a good portion of it inside.</p>

<p>While Uncle Isaac and Joe were doing this, and
making all snug, the boys unloaded one of the
sledges, and went back after the deer.</p>

<p>It was a glorious camp: the rock retained the
heat received from the fire; they had plenty of
venison, and now rested, and laid plans for the
future. That night, at twelve o’clock, began a
most furious snow storm; but little did they heed
it in their snug camp, with plenty to eat, and a
rousing fire. The snow drifting over the camp
made it all the warmer.</p>

<p>The storm continued two days, clearing off with
a high wind, and they remained in camp three
days.</p>

<p>Just afternoon on the following Saturday, Uncle
Isaac informed them that they were in the vicinity
of the river, upon a feeder of which they expected
to find the beavers. Joe told them there was an
old logging camp near by: they found the walls
of the old camp (which was built of very large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
logs) as good as ever; but the roof had fallen in.
The deacon’s seat, as it is called (made of a plank
hewed from a stick of timber, and which is always
placed beside the fire in logging camps), being
well preserved with grease and smoke, still remained.
It was but a light labor for so many
skilful hands to repair the roof, scrape out part of
the snow, and cover the remainder with brush.</p>

<p>After supper, during which Joe had been uncommonly
silent, he sat upon the deacon’s seat, his
arms folded upon his breast, and looking intently
into the fire.</p>

<p>This was so contrary to his usual custom (as he
was always the life of the camp-fire, with his merry
laugh), that they all gazed upon him with astonishment,
and Uncle Isaac was just about to ask
if he was sick, when he broke the silence by saying,
“This camp seems very natural to me; but it calls
up many different feelings: every inch of this
ground is familiar to me, though I haven’t been
on it, till I came here summer before last with the
surveyors, for ten years. I was just turned of
seventeen, a great, strapping boy, like John here,
when Richard Clay, who was foreman of the scout
that was going into the woods, persuaded my
father to let me go with them. Father was very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
loath to consent; he said I was too young for such
work; that I was a great, overgrown boy, and,
though large and smart, had not got my strength,
and it might strain and hurt me for life; that he
had known many such instances. But Richard
hung on, saying he would see that I did not overdo.
The gang was made up of our neighbors, and
young men, with all of whom I was acquainted,
and I was crazy to go. Dick offered me high
wages; father was poor, and wanted the money;
I coaxed mother, and got her on my side; finally
we prevailed, and wrung it out of father, and I
went. Well, as you may suppose, taking care of
me didn’t amount to a great deal. Dick wanted
to get all the logs cut he could, and I wanted no
favors, and it was just who could do the most; but
I was naturally tough, though I had grown fast;
for we were very poor when I was a boy, and I
had lived hard; my bones were made of Indian
corn, which I shall always think is the best stuff
to make bones of.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Uncle Isaac, by way of parenthesis.</p>

<p>Without heeding the interruption, Joe went on.
“Well, as I was saying, we were poor: father was
clearing up his farm; I had a natural turn to an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
axe, and had been used to falling and chopping
ever since I was fifteen years old, and, boy as I
was, could hold play with most men. Uncle Isaac,
you knew Sam Apthorp?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, very well; and a fine young man he
was.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Joe, “the Apthorps were our
neighbors. John Apthorp, Sam’s father, began
his clearing at the same time with mine; they cut
their first tree the same day. Sam was several
years older than I, and a powerful, smart fellow.
He took a great liking to me, and taught me about
hunting, trapping, and many other things, for he
was a master hunter; and as for me, I almost worshipped
him: it was for the sake of being with him
that made me so anxious to go. Sam and I, Dick
Clay, and another by the name of Rogers, came
up here in August to build a camp, cut hay, and
look out the timber. O, what a happy time that
was to me, though it was the worst and hardest
work I ever did before or since! It was all new to
me, and wild. That swale below where we shot
the deer hadn’t any bushes on it then, for it was
all covered with grass as high as your shoulder;
there is a brook runs through it, and the beaver
had dammed and flowed it, killing all the trees, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
suppose, a thousand years before; and then the
Indians, or somebody else, had broken the dam,
killed the beaver, let the water out, and the grass
had come in; you can see the old dam there yet.
Well, we came up to cut this hay: it was hot&mdash;scorching
hot&mdash;not a breath of wind; for it was
all surrounded with woods except a little gap,
where the brook ran into the river, and that was
filled with alders, and sich like. The black flies
and mosquitos were awful: the only way we could
live was to grease ourselves; but that only lasted a
little while, for the hot sun, and the heat of our
bodies sweating, would soon take it off, and then
they would come worse than ever. We came up
in a bateau, cut the hay, and stacked it up for our
oxen the next winter. O, how natural everything
here looks! There is not a log I helped cut and roll
up but has a memory belonging to it. This seat
we are sitting on Sam and I hewed out; we cut
the sapling within three feet of the door, and there
are our names, which he cut on it one Sabbath
morning; right in that corner we slept side by
side for two long winters; many a rousing meal
we’ve eat, and many a merry evening we’ve spent
around the fire; many’s the deer we’ve shot and
the beavers we’ve trapped together here. Poor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Sam! He had found a bear’s den, and we’d made
a plan for all hands to leave off work early in the
afternoon, and go and take them. All the evening
before we were sitting round the fire, I on that
seat and Sam in that corner, stretched out on the
brush, with his boots off, and his feet to the fire.
We were all laughing and talking, telling how we
would get them, and what we would do with
them; and Sam said he would carry a cub home,
learn it to dance, and go to Boston with it, as he
had read about their doing in the old country, and
make his everlasting fortune out of it. Sam Chesley,
our old cook, was rubbing his hands, and telling,
in high life, what steaks he’d fry, and how he
would cook it; and we agreed to cast lots for the
skin, on expectation, before we had got the bears,
or even seen them. We little thought, in our
happiness, what was in store for us. The next
day, about ten o’clock, Sam and I fell a large pine;
it had more top than such pines commonly have;
it came down between two big hemlocks, breaking
their branches, and clearing the way as it went.
A large limb, that we didn’t see, lodged in the
thick top of the hemlock; and as Sam went under
it, to cut off the top log, the second blow he struck,
down came the limb, as swift and silent as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
lightning, and struck him on the head and shoulders,
crushing him dead to the ground! He never
spoke or moved; when I got to him he was dead.
It was only a week before we were to break camp,
and go home. Sam and I had often, during the
last month, talked of the good times we would
have when we got home,&mdash;and then to bury him,
without a prayer or sermon, in the wilderness!
We had nothing to make a coffin, and so we took
two barrels that we had emptied of pork, and put
his head and shoulders in one, and the lower part
of his body in the other, and then fastened them
together, and buried him in his clothes, beneath
that great blazed pine that stands on the bank.
It was the first real sorrow I ever had. I had
never seen or thought anything of death before,
and this almost broke me down. I was through
here, as I told you, visited the grave, and saw the
camp, though I didn’t go into it; but it didn’t
make me feel as it does to sit here on this very
bench where I have sat with him, and see his name
cut on it, and the very place where we used to
sleep&mdash;” And hiding his face in his hand, he
burst into tears. There was not a dry eye in the
group.</p>

<p>“We didn’t stay but a week after this,” continued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
Joe; “we couldn’t work with any heart, any
of us; we never molested the bears, and were glad
to get away from the spot; nothing went right;
we lamed one of the oxen, one man cut himself
real bad, and we had sad news to carry home; for
they never heard a word till we came in the spring.”</p>

<p>The next day being Sunday, they remained in
camp.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>CAMPING.</small></h2>

<p>Monday morning it was splendid walking on
the crust; they made a long day’s march, travelling
till dark. Making a fire at the root of a tree, they
flung some brush on the snow, and laid down in
their blankets in the open air to sleep. Continuing
to follow the bank of the little stream, they
started some moose about ten o’clock in the day;
the crust would bear them, but not the moose,
who broke through at every step, staining the
snow with their blood. In those days moose were
more abundant in Maine than any other part of
New England. Pursuing them till sundown, they
succeeded in capturing one, and camped on the
trail. In the morning, resuming the pursuit, they
soon came in sight of the herd, but such is the
power of this animal, that, notwithstanding the
advantage which snow-shoes gave the men, it was
the middle of the afternoon before they came up
with them, and succeeded in killing four more. Relinquishing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
the pursuit, which now promised to lead
them in a different direction from that in which
they wished to go, they dressed the moose, hung
him on the trees out of the reach of wolves, and
wrapping themselves in the skins, laid down on
the snow to sleep.</p>

<p>“Joe,” said Uncle Isaac, “how far do you judge
we are from the spot the young man told you of?”</p>

<p>“I reckon about a mile.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hunted over some of this ground
twenty years ago, with the Indians, off to the
east’rd, and then again to the north’rd of us, where
there are many ponds, some of them having outlets
one into the other. Suppose, while we are cooking
some breakfast, you put on your snow-shoes
and take a look, and, if you think best, we’ll make
a permanent camp somewhere hereabouts; and as
we’ve got to live in it a good while, we’ll make
it well.”</p>

<p>In a short time Joe returned, saying, “I found
the place, and there are beavers enough.”</p>

<p>They immediately set about building their camp,
and determined to make it as home-like and comfortable
as possible. It was made of logs, from
which all the knots and bunches were trimmed,
and the crevices between them stuffed with moss
from the trees.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>Since they had come on the snow with sledges,
they were enabled to bring a great deal more
weight than if they had set out before the snow
came, as, in addition to the sledges, they also carried
light packs, and moreover intended to build
canoes, and return in the spring by the river.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac, thoroughly versed in wood-craft,
and always thoughtful, had brought an auger,
draw-shave, and a small saw on his sledge.</p>

<p>They split out cedar shingles, with the frow, four
feet long, fastening them to the rafters and purlins,
with poles held down with wooden pins and
withes. Upon these they put brush to break the
dash of the rain, and prevent the rain and snow
from being driven by force of the wind under the
shingles, as they intended it for a permanent camp,
in which to leave furs and provisions during their
absence on trapping and hunting excursions. They
made a solid door of cedar plank, hung on wooden
hinges, a deacon’s seat, and a rack around the
sides, covered with hemlock and cedar brush, for
bedsteads.</p>

<p>“We ought to have a stool or two,” said Uncle
Isaac; “we want something we can move round;
we can’t move the deacon’s seat, and we can’t
move the fire.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>He cut down a spruce that had long straight
limbs and cut some chunks from the top three
feet long, leaving a sufficient number of limbs on
each side for legs; he split the pieces in halves,
and smoothed the split side with a draw-shave.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, setting it up before the wondering
boys, “there’s a backwoodsman’s stool: them
are legs won’t want any gluing, and if anybody
wants a cushion, they can put some moss on it.”</p>

<p>While Uncle Isaac was at work on the stools,
Charlie, Joe, and John were splitting out boards
to make a table.</p>

<p>“The first stormy day that comes,” said Uncle
Isaac, “I’ll make some bark dishes, and the rest of
you can make some spoons, and we’ll have some
shelves; it’s just as well to be comfortable. There’s
just one thing we do want desperately; that is, a
fireplace, to keep the fire from spreading all over
the camp, taking up so much room, and also a
chimney, instead of a hole in the roof.”</p>

<p>“We can build a fireplace of green logs,” said
Joe.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it will burn out in a short time.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we couldn’t find some rocks or
clay somewhere; or is everything froze fast?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe but by cutting a little ice, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
could find stones, and clay too, in the river. It
don’t freeze hard here in the woods, as it does out
in the clear.”</p>

<p>The snow had come that year before the ground
froze, and under the bank of the stream they found
clay and flat stones, of which they built a fireplace,
and the chimney of sticks of wood and clay.</p>

<p>“There’s no end to wants,” said Uncle Isaac;
“now I want some birch-bark dishes.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to give that up,” said John, “for
the bark won’t run.”</p>

<p>“Won’t it? I’ll make it run.”</p>

<p>He warmed a birch tree with hot water, and
made the bark run as well as in the spring.</p>

<p>“Now get me some spruce roots, Charlie, and in
evenings and rainy days we’ll make the dishes.”</p>

<p>As they expected to hunt and trap over a large
extent of ground, they travelled about ten miles
farther on, and built a rough shanty in among several
ponds and small streams, where they expected
to find beavers, and placed in it some provisions;
then they took the back track, seven or eight miles
from the permanent camp, and built another on the
bank of the river, where they expected to find otter
and mink. They dignified the middle one with
the name of the home camp; that among the lakes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
they called the shanty, and the other the river
camp.</p>

<p>“We ought to have come up and done all this
before snow came,” said Uncle Isaac; “but now
we must do the best we can; perhaps we shall
blunder into good luck; people do sometimes.
There would have been a hundred beavers where
there is one, if it had not been for the French and
English.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Because, when the French held Canada, they
put the Indians up to breaking the dams and
destroying the beaver, to spite the English; and
now the English have got Canada, they do the
same, to spite us. An Indian, of his own accord,
won’t destroy game, any more than a farmer would
destroy his seed-corn: when they break into a
beaver house, they always throw back the young
ones, and part of the old, to breed; but a white
man takes the whole, because he’s afraid, if he
don’t, the next white trapper will.”</p>

<p>Beavers are industrious and provident, not, like
other animals that live by the chase and the slaughter
of other creatures, subject to a lack of food;
they are protected in their houses from violence,
and are so prolific, that, notwithstanding the merciless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
warfare waged upon them, by which they had
been driven from the sea-coasts even at that early
day, they were still abundant in those wilds whither
our adventurers had followed them. The beaver
is about three feet in length, averaging in weight
sixty pounds; its tail is a foot in length, flat, and
covered with scales; the feet and legs flat and
short, with a membrane between the toes; it has
very strong and large cutting teeth, the upper ones
two and a half inches long, and the lower ones
three inches: with these teeth they will cut down
a tree eight inches through; and if a tree stands
in just the right place, and they want it very much,
they won’t hesitate to cut it if it is a foot through.
When the beavers are two years old, they build
houses, and set up for themselves, as they don’t
like to live on their parents. They breathe air,
and therefore cannot live a long time under water;
neither can they live without having constant access
to the water; they are, therefore, compelled
to build in water so deep that it will not freeze at
the bottom; the entrance is under water: by diving
beneath the ice, they can get at the lily-roots on
the bottom of the pond, and also obtain access to
holes in the bank, which they provide for retreat
in the event of being disturbed in their houses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
They feed on the wood and bark of trees, which
they cut down and sink in front of their houses, in
order to obtain it in the winter.</p>

<p>Their houses are built of branches of trees, mud,
and stones, from two to six or eight feet in thickness,
and, when frozen hard, bid defiance to all
attacks, save those of man. They have an elevated
platform in them, above the surface of the water,
on which they sleep. They break the ice every
night, opposite their holes in the bank, for a breathing-hole,
thus keeping it open, that in pleasant
days they may go into the woods. They often
build in a pond, but generally prefer to dam a
brook, and make their own pond; then, when they
want wood to repair their houses or dams, or for
provision in winter, they can make a raft up stream
and, getting on to it, float down with the stream,
steering with their paws.</p>

<p>After completing their camp, and making all
their arrangements, they approached the spot, and
perceived that the animals had dammed a large
brook. In the midst of the pond thus formed, surrounded
by snow and ice, which covered them
nearly to their tops, were twelve large beaver
houses. All was still as death: the sun shone
clear on the snow-covered houses, beneath which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
in a half-torpid state, the beavers were reposing,
most effectually sheltered from the cold and from
beasts of prey. Safe beneath the ice was their
winter supply of food: all they had to do when
hungry was to go a few feet, and obtain it.</p>

<p>The party walked carefully over the ice, and
Uncle Isaac pointed out to the boys the breathing-holes
in it.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, by way of summing up, “I
reckon there are not less than a hundred beavers
under this snow and ice, and likely to be more than
less.”</p>

<p>“A hundred beavers!” cried John, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes; there’s ten in a house, old and young,
I’ll warrant&mdash;not less than ten: I’ve seen twenty-five
taken out of one house. They’re not ours yet,
my boy!” slapping John on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Be they good to eat?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Nothing better, especially the tails. I call a
singed beaver a dish to set before a king.”</p>

<p>“Why do they singe them?”</p>

<p>“You see, a beaver in the winter is as fat as a
hog, and the fat lies on the outside; you want the
skin, just as you do the rind of pork; so, if you can
afford to singe the fur all off, and lose that, he will
be just like a scalded hog. I’m in hopes we shall
get enough to be able to singe at least one.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<p>In the course of the day they discovered three
other beaver settlements, two of them in ponds
made by damming up a brook, and the other in a
large natural pond. They also discovered otter-slides
and fishing-holes, where the otters fished a
great quantity of muskrat, dens and tracks of minks
along the river banks and brooks.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Uncle Isaac, “let us look for bears.
I’ve seen signs, more or less, for the last two or
three miles.”</p>

<p>“What are the signs, Uncle Isaac?” asked
Charlie. “I don’t see any.”</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac smiled, and pointed to a clump of
oaks and beeches on the side of the brook, the top
limbs of which were all bent in, and many of them
broken off.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose bent and broke all these
limbs?”</p>

<p>“Why, the wind, or the snow, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“But neither the wind or the snow would bend
them in; it would bend them down; but these are
turned up, and bent in.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” said Charlie. “What
did?”</p>

<p>“Why, the bears.”</p>

<p>“The bears! What for?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>“Why, the bears live on acorns and beech-nuts;
they go a-nutting, as well as boys, climb up into
the top of a tree, just like a cat, and, when they’ve
got as high as the limbs will bear, they sit down in
the crotch of a large limb, reach out their paws,
and pull the smaller limbs in, and eat off the beech-nuts
and acorns; they will pull in and break off a
limb as big as my arm. There have been plenty
of bears round here late this fall. There are lots
of them asleep under these old windfalls, and in
hollow trees, and we must find them, and mark
the trees; then we can get them when we like.”</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far in their search when
Joe exclaimed, “I’ve found one!”</p>

<p>He was standing at the foot of an enormous
elm, which, being hollow, had broken off about
twenty feet from the ground.</p>

<p>“How do you know there is a bear there?”
asked Charlie. “I don’t see any.”</p>

<p>At this all laughed, when Uncle Isaac pointed
out to Charlie a regular line of grooves and
scratches, extending from the bottom to the top
of the tree, left by the bear’s claws, where it had
gone up and down; he also told him that the bear
went into his den in November, and remained
asleep, without eating or coming out, till spring,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
and that it was a she bear, because they always
lived by themselves, and in trees, if hollow, or
windfalls, if they could find them, to keep their
young from the wolves and the males; that if
there was a bear there, she probably had cubs,
perhaps four, but at least two; perhaps eight, for
if she had two litters in one year, she would make
a den close by for the first cubs; both litters follow
her the next summer, and the next winter all live
together. They generally weigh from three to
four hundred.</p>

<p>They found many more dens under windfalls,
and the roots of trees, and sides of rocks, for the
bear is so well protected by his thick coat as to be
nearly insensible to cold, and will content himself
very well, with a little brush for a bed, under the
side of a root that has been turned up, or a rock,
though the female will seek out a hollow tree.
They discovered the dens either by scratches on
the stubs, or by noticing where the breath of the
bear had stained and melted the snow.</p>

<p>Having marked all the places, in order to find
them again, they returned to the home camp.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>UNCLE ISAAC’S BEAR STORY.</small></h2>

<p>After supper they sat around the fire consulting
as to future movements. Bears were very
abundant in those days.</p>

<p>In 1783 no fewer than ten thousand five hundred
bear-skins were sent to England from the
northern ports of America.</p>

<p>In 1805, eleven years subsequent to the date
of our story, the number had reached twenty-five
thousand.</p>

<p>“It is going to be a great deal of work,” said
Uncle Isaac, “to get these beavers now. The ice
is thick in the pond, the houses are seven or eight
feet thick, and frozen as hard as a stone. It will
be hard work to break them up&mdash;a great deal of
ice to cut, and frozen dirt. If we dull our tools,
we’ve nothing but a file to sharpen them with. I
think we’d better make a lot of dead-falls and box-traps,
and set them for minks and sables, cut holes
in the ice, and set steel-traps for the beaver and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
otters; and while we are tending them, go into the
muskrats, coons, and bears, till the weather begins
to get warmer; then the sun will thaw the south
side of their houses, and the ice in the ponds, and
we can get what beavers are left with half the
work. What do you think, Joseph?”</p>

<p>“I think just as you do; but we must have fish
to bait the otter traps. I have got hooks and lines
in my pack. We can also make nets of willow
bark, and set them under the ice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we can set for foxes. If we could
get a silver-gray, it would be worth a lot of
money.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that, and have brought some
honey. That will tole them. A fox loves honey
as well as a bear; so does a coon, and a coon is
out every thawy day. I count heavy on bears. A
bear’s pelt is worth forty shillings; and we may
find a yard of deer. Just as soon as we begin to
have carcasses of beaver and fish round, it will
draw the foxes, and we can trap and shoot them
on the bait.”</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac now brought out his pack, and began
to remove some of the contents, laying them
one by one on the table, while the boys looked on
with great curiosity. The first thing he took out
was a bunch of the largest sized mackerel hooks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>“What in the world did you bring them clear
up here for?” asked John. “There are no mackerel
here.”</p>

<p>“They are to make a wolf-trap.”</p>

<p>“How do you make it?”</p>

<p>“O, you’ll see.”</p>

<p>He next took two slim, pointed steel rods, nearly
three feet long, from the outside of his pack,
where they were fastened, as they were too long
to go inside.</p>

<p>“What are those?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Muskrat spears,” said Joe. “That will be fun
alive for you boys.”</p>

<p>The next articles were three little bottles filled
with some liquid.</p>

<p>“What are these?”</p>

<p>“That’s telling,” said Uncle Isaac, laying another
vial on the table.</p>

<p>John removed the cork, and smelt of it. “That’s
aniseseed. What’s it for?”</p>

<p>“To tole foxes and fishes.”</p>

<p>“What’s this?”&mdash;taking up another.</p>

<p>“That’s telling.”</p>

<p>“O, how it smells!&mdash;like rotten fish. What
is it for?”</p>

<p>“To tole minks.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<p>“And this?”&mdash;taking up another.</p>

<p>“To tole beavers.”</p>

<p>“What is in this little bag?”</p>

<p>“If you must know, Mr. Inquisitive, it is some
earth that I got from the place where Joe Bradish
kept some foxes, and that they laid on all summer.
I’m in hopes to get a silver or cross fox,
with it.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Isaac, do give me some of that honey!&mdash;just
the least little bit of a taste!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll give you all just a taste; but I want
it to tole foxes and coons.”</p>

<p>He gave them all a little on the point of his
knife.</p>

<p>As they were going to devote much of their
time to hunting bears, it was a matter of course
that the habits and methods of taking that animal
should, to a great extent, afford matter for conversation
around the camp fire.</p>

<p>“A bear,” said Uncle Isaac, drawing up his
knees, clasping his hands over them, and resting
his chin upon them, as his habit was when he was
about to tell a story, “is a singular critter.”</p>

<p>John threw some fresh fuel on the fire, and
squatting down on the ground, with both arms on
the deacon’s seat, and his mouth wide open, sat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
with his eyes riveted on the old hunter’s face,
drinking in every word, while Charlie and Joe
Griffin disposed themselves in attitudes of attention.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” continued Uncle Isaac, “bear any
malice against a bear, as I do against a wolf,
though they have done me a deal of mischief in
my day, because they are not a bloodthirsty animal.
A wolf will bite the throats of a whole flock
of sheep, just to suck their blood.”</p>

<p>“Why, Uncle Isaac,” said Joe, “didn’t a bear
kill little Sally Richards only last summer? and all
they found of her was just her clothes, feet, and
shoes? He had eaten all the rest of her up, and
was gnawing her skull when they found and shot
him; and wasn’t she my own cousin?&mdash;pretty
little bright creature as ever lived! I’m sure I
should think that was being bloodthirsty.”</p>

<p>“That was a she bear, and had cubs following
her; and <i>then</i> they are savage; but at other times
a bear will let you alone if you will let him alone.
They will always turn out for a man. A woman
might pick blueberries all day in a pasture with a
bear, and if she let him alone he would let her
alone. But if they have young ones, or are starving,
or you pen them up, then look out! I’ve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
heard the Indians say that in the fall, when they
are fat and getting sleepy, you may put a stick in
their mouths and lead them anywhere; and my
mother has picked cranberries in a swamp with six
bears, because she wanted the berries before they
eat ’em all up, and they never meddled with her.
Then they are such comical critters! Why, you
can learn a bear anything. When I was a boy, I
used to have a cub ’most every winter; and when,
by the next fall, they began to be troublesome, and
father would shoot them, I cried as if my heart
would break.</p>

<p>“There was one,” said he, stirred by the recollections
of his youth, unclasping his hands, rising
up, turning round, then sitting down again, “that
I loved better than all the rest. I used to call him
C&aelig;sar, after an old black slave who belonged to
one of our neighbors. Father was a great hunter,
and so were all the old folks, for they would have
starved to death, when they first came, if it had
not been for their rifles, and powder was so scarce
they could not afford to waste shots. Well, one
fall the frost cut off all the acorns, berries, and
cranberries, so there was not a berry to be found.
The bears were starving. They came down clear
from Canada, and swarmed all along the salt water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
after clams, lobster, flounders, and raccoons. O, I
never knew the strength of a bear till then! Captain
Rhines was a young man, and mate of a vessel
then. My father, and a good many of the neighbors,
had sent out fowls, and butter, and cheese, as
a venture by him, and got molasses for it. Mr.
Rhines, as he was then, had brought it down from
Salem with his things, landed it at our point,
rolled it up on the beach out of the tide’s way,
and left it till the owners could haul it off. It
staid there a day or two. One morning father and
Uncle Sam Edwards went to haul it up, when they
found the head of every barrel smashed in, just as
if it had been done with an axe. The bears,
which, as I told you, were as thick as hops, had
done it with their paws, and upset, eat, and wasted
the whole of it. As they were going home, lamenting
their hard luck, they met a bear&mdash;drunk!
John Carver had put up a story-and-a-half log
house the day before, and they had left a pailful of
new rum, sweetened with molasses, sitting on some
boards in the garret. This bear had smelt it,
climbed up, and drank it all up. How he got
down I don’t know; but it operated so quick he
couldn’t get off, and there he was, all stuck over
with molasses, where he had been with the rest of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
them down to the shore. He had got it all over
his ears and breast, and the chips, where they had
hewed the frame, all stuck to him, and he was the
queerest sight you ever saw! He couldn’t walk,
but would sit up and look at us, and then roll over
on one side, then get back again, and looked so
comical, that notwithstanding their sorrow for
their loss, they all burst out laughing; and Uncle
Sam Edwards, who was a jolly, funny creetur
himself, carried on so with him, and made such
queer observations, that father laughed till he had
to lie down on the ground. None of them had a
gun, but they took the stakes out of the sleds,
which they had brought to haul the molasses on,
and pounded him on the head till they killed him.
Uncle Sam, who himself drank a good deal more
than was good for him, said, when he gave him
the last blow, ‘You see now what stealing and
hard drinking will bring a bear to.’ After skinning
him, they had a long consultation as to whether he
was fit to eat. Father said he didn’t want to eat
anything that died drunk; but Uncle Sam said he
didn’t die of liquor, for they had killed and bled
him, and as for himself, he would eat him; so said
John Carver; but father said he wouldn’t; so they
gave father the skin, and they took the meat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Father carried the skin home, and mother washed
and combed out the fur, and in the cold nights
that winter she used to put it on my bed, and it
is in our house yet.</p>

<p>“A bear is a master strong creature. To see what
a rock they would turn over that fall to get a lobster!
It was great fun to see the bears catch
coons; they would go round till they saw two or
three coons in a tree; one bear would climb the
tree, and the coons, seeing him, would run clear up
to the top, where the limbs were small, and
wouldn’t bear the weight of the bear; but the
bear would follow as far as he could go, then
shake off the coons, and the ones below would
catch them; they would dig them out of holes, or
crush up a log if it was rotten. They are bewitched
after anything sweet, especially honey,
and if they find a hive they will surely rob it.</p>

<p>“Old Mr. John Elwell, Sam’s father, had a hive
of bees: they swarmed, and took for the woods, and
got on a tree; he followed them and hived them.
There were two maple trees, that grew within
three feet of each other; so he put a plank between
them, and set a hive on it, meaning to carry them
home in the fall, when it was cold and the bees
got stiff.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>“One night he was going after his cows, and
thought he would take a look at the bees. He
found the hive on the ground all stove to pieces;
every drop of honey licked clean out of it. The
bears had got well stung, for the bark was torn
off the trees all around where they had bitten
them in their rage and anger. But a bear is so
covered with fur, that only a small part of him
is exposed to the sting of the bees; and no matter
how much anguish it causes them, they will have
the honey.</p>

<p>“They plagued us terribly that fall; you couldn’t
get a wild grape, nor a choke-cherry, for them, and
it kept us at work all the fall watching the cattle
and corn, and setting spring-guns and dead-falls.
There was one old she bear that father swore
vengeance against. We had the sheep for safety
in a log sheep-house in the yard, but she climbed
over the fence, tore off the roof, and carried away
the old ram. She had two white stripes on each
side of her nose, and was well known; she had
been hunted again and again, and once had been
wounded by a spring-gun and tracked by the
blood; but she could not be overtaken, nor could
her den be found. We had six hogs that year,
that lived in the pasture, and every day at low
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
water went a clamming. We had put them up
for fear of the bears. One old sow was in a pen by
herself, fatting. We were going to kill her in a
week. We had just fed the cattle, and set down
to supper, when we heard a terrible squealing, all
the hogs squealing as if to see which could squeal
the loudest, and the rooster crowing. We ran out.
There was that old white-nosed bear, with the
sow hugged up in her fore paws, walking off on
her hind legs, just as easy as a man would walk
with a baby. Father ran back, caught the gun
out of the bracket, but before he could load, the
bear was in the woods. It had got to be dark, and
the old sow’s cries could no more be heard. He
raised the neighbors. They took firebrands and
searched the woods; but the ground was froze too
hard to find the trail, and so the bear got off with
her booty. You may well think father was greatly
enraged, not only at the loss of his property, but
he was greatly vexed that so distinguished a hunter
as he was should be thus insulted by a bear.
He did nothing else but scour the woods for that
bear, and as nearly all the neighbors had some
cause of complaint against her, he had assistance
enough, but all in vain. He had set a steel bear-trap,
dead-falls, and spring-guns for her, but she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
was too knowing to be caught. She sprung the
steel-trap, which he had baited and covered up
in chaff, by going all round the bait and trap in a
circle, and thumping on the ground with her fore
feet, coming nearer and nearer till she jarred
it off.</p>

<p>“On the last of that winter there came a great
thaw, and took off all the snow on the open
ground. It was so warm the old bear came out,
and begun her depredations. Father went and
borrowed three steel bear-traps, set one in the
middle, and baited it, and the others round it, and
put no bait on them, covered them up in dirt, and
put a long chain to them, with a grapple to it.</p>

<p>“The second night one of the outside traps was
gone&mdash;chain, grappling, and all. The bear, too
cunning to go into the trap where the bait was,
had stepped into one of those that was covered
up, while trying to jar the other off. Father
sent me right off for John Elwell, while he loaded
his gun and got ready. Uncle John came, and
with him Black C&aelig;sar. C&aelig;sar was a master powerful
man, and as spry as a cat. I cried and roared
to go, but father refused, saying I might get hurt,
and there was no knowing how far they might
have to go, nor when they should get back; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
C&aelig;sar, with whom I was a great favorite, said he
would take care of me, and that he didn’t believe
the bear could carry that chain and grappling a
great way. Finally father yielded. There was no
trouble in tracking the bear, for the grappling had
torn up the ground where it had hitched into the
cradle-knolls and bushes. Sometimes they lost the
trail for a good while, when it was evident that the
bear had taken up the grappling, when it got fast,
and carried it; and father said she must be caught
by her fore paws, as he knew by her track that she
walked on her hind legs, sometimes half a mile&mdash;trap,
grappling, and all. They followed her into
the woods nearly two miles, C&aelig;sar helping me
over the windfalls, and sometimes taking me on
his shoulder, till finally, at Millbrook, we lost her
track altogether. In vain they searched the woods.
There was no sign of bear or trap. Discouraged,
they gave it up, and sat down on the bank of the
brook.</p>

<p>“Uncle John said she had got the grappling
caught trying to swim the river, and was drowned,
and he hoped she was. They had all about come
to that conclusion, when I, who was playing on
the bank, was attracted by some beautiful white
and yellow moss growing at the roots of a black
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
ash, and going to get some, saw the grappling
hooked over the main root of the ash. I instantly
ran back, crying with fright, and feeling in fancy
the bear’s claws on my throat. It was the most
singular place for a den you ever saw. You might
have gone within three feet of it, and never suspected
its existence.</p>

<p>“The stream, which had formerly flowed under
a high bank, had shifted its channel in some
freshet, and the frost, working on the bank after
the water was gone, had thrown down a great
rock, which, catching one corner on the butt and
the other on the roots of the big ash, was thus
held up, while the earth beneath crumbled away.
Under this shelf, with a very little work, the bear
had made her den; and there she was, with her
right fore leg in the trap, on a bed of pine boughs,
with the grappling,&mdash;which she had not had time to
bring in, we had followed her so closely,&mdash;caught
in the roots at the mouth, which, had it not happened,
we should never have found her. Father,
with the greatest satisfaction, put two balls through
her head, and then, taking hold of the chain, they
dragged her out. When they found three cubs,
you may well think I was delighted. I hugged,
kissed, and patted them, and thought they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
the prettiest things I ever saw in my life.
They were less than a foot long, had no teeth,
and had not got their eyes open. O, how I
begged to carry them all home! Father wouldn’t
hear to it, but allowed me to have one, and take
my choice. I took the one that had a white face,
like the old one, and cried well when they knocked
the others on the head. C&aelig;sar carried the cub
home for me, and in gratitude I called him after
him. How I loved that cub! I got some cow’s
milk, put it in a pan, and then put my finger in his
mouth, and he would suck it, and thus suck up the
milk. We carried him out to the barn, and tried
to have him suck like a calf; but as soon as the cow
smelt him, she was half crazy with fear, kicked,
roared, broke her bow, and ran out of the barn.
We never tried it again.</p>

<p>“He soon began to have teeth, and then would
eat bread and potatoes, and most anything, but
sugar and molasses was his great delight. He
soon made friends with the dog and cat, and
would play with them by the hour together.</p>

<p>“In the summer he would catch mice, frogs, and
crickets, and get into mud-holes in the woods, and
roll over till he was covered with mud; and when
the wild berries, acorns, and hazel-nuts came, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
lived first rate. In the first part of the spring he
would eat the young sprouts and tender leaves of
the trees,&mdash;anything that was juicy,&mdash;and would
rob birds’ nests. As mother used to make me
churn, I learned him to stand on his hind legs and
help me, which he would sometimes do for half an
hour, at other times but a few minutes. He would
haul me on the sled as long as he liked, but when
he thought he’d done it enough, there was no such
thing as making him do any more. If I tried to
force him, he would take me up in his paws and
set me on a log, or leave me and run up a tree.
He was very quick to imitate, and seeing me one
night carrying in the night’s wood, he took up a
log in his paws, and, standing on his hind legs,
walked in with it, and laid it by the fireplace.
Ever after that he brought in all the night’s wood,&mdash;that
is, all the logs,&mdash;but he wouldn’t touch the
small wood, seeming to think that beneath him.
He would take a log that three men couldn’t
move, and walk off with it. Indeed, I believe a
bear is stronger on his hind legs than in any other
way, for they always stand up for a fight.</p>

<p>“It was no small help to have him carry in the
great logs, three feet through, that I used to have
to haul on a sled, and the backsticks and foresticks;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
but I hated to do chores as bad as any boy
ever did, and used to try to coax him with bread
and molasses, and even honey, to carry in the
small wood, but it was no use. He would eat
the bread and honey, but wouldn’t touch the
wood.</p>

<p>“I believe, if we’d only thought of it, we might
have taught that bear to chop wood; for a bear
will handle his paws as well as a man his hands.
You throw anything to a bear, and he’ll catch it;
and there’s not one man to a hundred can strike a
bear with an axe. He will knock it out of his
hand with a force that will make his fingers tingle.</p>

<p>“But the greatest amusement was in the summer
nights. In the daytime he would lay round and
sleep; but as night came on, he grew playful and
wide awake. He would chase the dog, and then
the cats till they would run up into the red oak at
the door, then follow them as far as the limbs
would bear him, pull them in, and catch them or
shake them off.</p>

<p>“We kept him three years, and then had to kill
him. It was a sad day to me. It was the first
real trouble I ever had, and I don’t know as I
could have felt any worse if it had been a human
being. When I found it was determined on, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
went over to Uncle Reuben’s, and staid a week.
I think all our folks felt almost as bad as I did.”</p>

<p>“But what on earth did you kill him for, Uncle
Isaac?”</p>

<p>“Why, we had to. He was always mischievous;
but as he grew older, he grew worse. He would
dig up potatoes after they were planted in the
spring, and also in the fall; and he would break
down and waste three or four bushels of corn to
get a few ears to eat, when it was in the milk.
Did you ever see how a bear works in a cornfield?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, he gets in between the rows, spreads his
fore paws, smashes down three or four hills, and
then lies down on the heap and eats.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t kill the hogs, but would chase
them all over the pasture, and into the water, and
two or three were drowned. You couldn’t put
anything out of his reach, for there was no place
he couldn’t climb to, a door in the house he
couldn’t open, nor scarcely anything he couldn’t
break. Though spry as a cat, he wouldn’t climb
over a pair of bars, but would take them down,
and leave them, go ranging round nights, and let
the cattle into the fields. He would steal yarn,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
that was put out to whiten, to make a bed of. He
was the means of our keeping bees. He came
home one day in April with his nose all swelled
up, and half blind. He had found a swarm of bees
in a hollow tree, and tried to get at them; but the
hole in the tree was so small that he couldn’t get
his paw in, and the bees stung him till he was glad
to retreat, finding he could get nothing. We
tracked him in the snow that was still in the
woods, cut the tree down, and brought it home.
He used to plague us to death in sap time, drinking
the sap and upsetting the trough, and we had
to chain him up. But the crowning mischief, and
that which cost him his life, was stealing butter.”</p>

<p>“Stealing butter!” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes: father had long been sick of him, and
threatened to kill him; but mother and I begged
him off. My sister Mary was going to be married;
mother was making and selling all the butter she
could, to get her a little outfit: it was hot weather,
and she put some butter she was going to send to
market in a box, tied it up in a cloth, and lowered
it down the well, to keep cool. In the
morning I saddled the horse to go to market;
mother went to the well to get the butter, but
there was no butter there. As soon as she could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
speak, for grief and anger, she exclaimed, ‘That
awful bear!’</p>

<p>”We went to his nest under the barn, and there
was the box, licked as clean as a woman could
wash it. The wicked brute hauled it up, bit the
rope in two, and carried off the butter. That
sealed his fate: mother said she wouldn’t intercede
for him any more, and I couldn’t say a word,
though I wanted to; and so ‘he died of butter.’</p>

<p>“I felt so bad that I never cared to have any
pets after that.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>RAID ON A BEAVER SETTLEMENT.</small></h2>

<p>They now occupied every moment, from daylight
and before, till in the evening, in hunting
bears, digging out coons, stretching and scraping
the skins, and trapping beaver and foxes.</p>

<p>The camp inside was hung around with skins,
and outside the snow was covered with the bodies
of the different animals, which attracted the wolves
in troops, and the woods resounded with their
howlings.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac set a steel trap in a spring of water,
and caught two silver-gray foxes. He now took four
of the large mackerel-hooks, fastened them together,
and wound them with twine, so as to form a grappling,
fastened a strong cord, made of twisted deer
sinews, to them, dipped them in grease, permitting
it to cool after every dip, till the hooks were all
covered in the great bunch of grease, fastened the
rope to a tree, and kept watch. It was not long
before a hungry wolf swallowed the ball of grease,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
and, the hooks sticking in his throat, he was caught.
The steel traps, which were very scarce in that
day, and were all imported, were used for beaver,
otter, and two of them for foxes; the other animals
were taken in dead-falls and box-traps.</p>

<p>As they had a frow, to split out boards, and a
saw, they made many box-traps, putting them
together with wooden pins, and in them caught
great numbers of minks and muskrats; they also
killed many deer and moose.</p>

<p>The traps for beaver were set in holes cut in the
ice, and the bait was scented, and made attractive
with the composition in Uncle Isaac’s vials. Another
method was to dig a pit in the ground, make
a road to it with stakes, then hang a board between
the stakes, so nicely balanced, that, when the animal
stepped upon it, it would turn, and let him
into the pit. In order to attract the game, the
bait was dragged along the ground, that it might
leave its scent between the line of stakes, then
placed beyond the pit, that the animal, in following
up the scent, might step on the trap. The dead-falls
were constructed by making an enclosure of
stakes, open at one end, inside of which a piece of
wood was laid on the ground crosswise, and fastened.
They then fastened a heavy piece of hard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
wood to a stake with a peg, so that it would play
up and down easily: this was called the killer, the
end of which was held up by a thong of deer sinew,
which went over another crotchet stake driven
into the ground. Through this stake a hole was
bored, to admit a spindle; the string which held
up the killer was fastened by a flat piece of wood,
one end of which went into a notch in the stake,
the other into a notch in the end of the spindle,
like the spindle of a common box-trap; another
heavy piece of wood was then placed one end on
the ground, between two stakes, to keep it from
rolling, the other on the top of the killer, to give
force to the fall. When the animal touched the
spindle to which the bait was fastened, both the
killer and the stick placed on to re&euml;nforce it came
down, and caught him between the killer and the
piece on the ground.</p>

<p>In default of an auger, it could all be made with
an axe, by using double stakes and strings, or
withes. These were made larger or smaller, according
to the size of the animal to be caught;
they were surrounded with stakes, and covered on
top with brush, to keep the animal from robbing
them behind, or on top. For beaver, they set
them in the paths where they went to the woods,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
cut a piece of wood, flat on the upper side, four
inches wide, and bevelling on the under side, so
that it would rotate, canting it down on one edge,
put that edge under the end of the spindle, and
strewed over it twigs and chips of red willow and
beaver root, rubbed with medicine, and when the
beaver put his mouth or paw on the board it
canted, and, lifting the end of the spindle, sprung
the trap.</p>

<p>For raccoons, they set them at the ends of hollow
logs, and in the little runs that led down to
the ponds and brooks; and for the otter, at the
places where they rubbed when they came out of
the water, and near their sliding places. For raccoons,
they baited with frogs, and chips of bears’
and beavers’ meat, with honey dropped on it; and
for otters, with fish which they caught through
holes in the ice.</p>

<p>As the winter wore away, thaws became more
frequent, and the coons and beaver began to awake
from their half-torpid state, they caught more and
more, getting ten or twelve beavers a night.</p>

<p>They now separated, part of them living in the
house camp, and part at the river camp and shanty,
for the greater convenience of tending the traps,
which were scattered along a range of many miles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
all assembling at the home camp on the Lord’s
day, when they had a meeting. As the season was
now approaching when the ice would begin to
break up, and the frequent rains had rendered the
ice transparent, so they could see the beavers and
muskrats under it, they determined to attack them
in their houses. In the first place, they prepared
and sharpened a great number of stakes, and, cutting
through the ice, drove them into the bottom
of the pond, around the houses, and around the
holes in the bank, thus fastening the beavers in;
then tearing down the houses with tools they had
brought with them, they knocked the beavers on
the head, and flung them out on the ice.</p>

<p>Beavers and muskrats will swim under the ice
as long as they can hold their breath, then breathe
it out against the ice: when it has absorbed oxygen
from the water, they will take the bubble in
again, and go on; the boys would follow them up,
and, before they had time to take in the bubble,
strike with their hatchets over them, and drive
them away from their breath, when they would
soon drown, and could be cut out.</p>

<p>They labored unremittingly, under the wildest
excitement, stopping neither to eat nor drink till
nearly sundown, when, bathed in perspiration,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
every house was in ruins, and the ice thickly
strewn with dead beavers: they then desisted.</p>

<p>“We are all as hot as we can be,” said Uncle
Isaac. “The first thing to be done is to put on
our clothes, and make a fire to cool off by. We’ve
got about four tons of beaver carcasses here: it
would take all night to haul them to the camp;
and if we leave them here, all the wolves in the
woods will be on hand, and not a hide of them be
left by morning. So I don’t see any other way
than to build a camp, and stay here; and we can
have our choice, either to take them into the camp,
or sit up by turns, and watch them.”</p>

<p>“I say take them into the camp,” said Joe Griffin.
“And here’s just the place to build it, on this
old windfall.”</p>

<p>“Now, Charlie,” said Uncle Isaac, “while we
are building a camp, you and John run to the
home camp, and get the kettle, a birch dish, and
some tea.”</p>

<p>The rude shelter, sufficient for these hardy men,
was soon completed, the beaver brought inside,
and a fire built. Uncle Isaac proposed, as they
had met with such luck, that they should have a
beaver singed for supper. “They could afford it,”
he said, “though, of course, it spoilt the skin.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span></p>

<p>This was unanimously agreed to, when, picking
out one of the youngest and fattest, they cut off
his tail, scalded and scraped off the scales, then,
holding the rest over the fire, singed off all the
hair, and scraped it clean with their knives. While
Joe was turning the spit, and John making tea,
Charlie noticed Uncle Isaac picking out some of
the dryest of the wood, and piling it up a little
distance from the camp, and putting beneath it a
parcel of birch bark, as if he was going to light a
fire.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>The old gentleman would give him no answer,
only saying, with a knowing look, that he would
see before morning.</p>

<p>The beaver, being roasted, was placed in the
birch dish. Sitting round it, these hungry men,
who had eaten nothing since long before the break
of day, made fierce onslaught with their hunting-knives.
For nearly half an hour no sound was
heard but that of vigorous mastication, and the
crackling of the fire. At length Joe, after looking
round upon his companions and the great pile of
game with a look of the most intense satisfaction,
and speaking thick, with a rib of beaver between
his teeth, broke the silence by saying “Haven’t
we done it this time, Uncle Isaac?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Joseph,” replied the old hunter, speaking
with great deliberation, and giving the name in
full, a habit he had when much pleased, “we certainly
have. I’ve been trapping in the woods winters,
more or less, ever since I was a boy, with the
Indians, and when the beavers were a great deal
more plenty than they are now; but I never saw
near so many taken at one time before.”</p>

<p>Some time during the night, John, who slept
nearest to the door, was awakened by a concert of
sounds so horrible that it caused him to jump right
up on his feet, with a cry that awoke the rest, and,
grasping Joe by the shoulder, exclaimed, “For
Heaven’s sake, what is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s wolves,” said Uncle Isaac. “I was calculating
on them: they scent the roast meat; the
fire has burnt low, and that emboldens them.
Throw on some wood, Joe; they must be taught
to keep their distance, or there’ll be no sleep,” said
he; and taking up a brand, he set fire to the pile
outside, which lighting up the forest, the wolves
withdrew, but still kept up their howling at a distance.
It was now evident why Uncle Isaac had
prepared the pile of wood out doors.</p>

<p>“We were careless,” said he, “to let the fire get
so low, and might have paid dearly for it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>“Why,” said John, “will they tackle men?”</p>

<p>“Yes, when there is a drove of them, and they
are hungry: they are cowardly, cruel creeturs; I hate
’em,” said he, as they stood gazing on the gaunt
forms flitting among the trees just beyond the line
of fire-light, licking their dry jaws, and snapping
their tusks. One old gray wolf, who seemed to be
a leader, followed the track made by dragging the
bodies of the beavers to the very edge of the
shadow cast by the woods, so that his head and
shoulders were distinctly visible.</p>

<p>“Only see the cruel varmint!” said Uncle Isaac;
“see those jaws and tusks, and that great red
tongue. We ought not to waste powder, but that
fellow tempts a man too much: fire at him, John;
aim for his eyes, and I’ll finish him if you don’t.”</p>

<p>John, needing no second admonition, fired on
the instant, when the wolf, leaping forward, fell his
whole length in the snow, and, rolling over a few
times, stretched out, quivered, and became motionless.</p>

<p>“I mean to skin him in the morning,” said John.</p>

<p>“Then you must put him in the camp; for if he
lies there, nothing will be left of him in the morning
but bones.”</p>

<p>“Why, will the wolves eat each other?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>“Eat each other? Yes, just as quick as they’ll
eat anything else. There’s no Christianity in ’em.
They will dig up a dead body in a graveyard.”</p>

<p>“But how shall I get him?” said John, who,
after this revelation, did not feel much like trusting
himself far from the fire.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac seized a brand, and, waving it in
the air, the wolves retreated, and John took the
dead wolf by the hind legs, and drew him to the
fire.</p>

<p>After replenishing both fires with fuel, they lay
down again, and were soon fast asleep, except
John and Charlie, from whose eyes the events of
the evening and the howling of the wolves had
effectually banished sleep until near daybreak, when
they too sank into a sound slumber.</p>

<p>They now broke into the other beaver houses,
and, as the weather grew warmer, tapped the
maples, procured sap to drink, and made sugar;
and, as they could boil but little in their camp-kettle,
they froze the sap. This took the water
out, and reduced the quantity, leaving that which
remained very sweet, and so much less in quantity
to boil down.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>BREAKING CAMP.</small></h2>

<p>“There are just two things,” said Uncle Isaac,
“for us to make up our minds about. We’ve had
great luck. We’ve got two silver-gray foxes,
which is an uncommon thing. I lay it to the
honey that I fried the bait in, the bloody neck of a
moose that I dragged along the trail, and the earth
I got from Joe Bradish’s fox-pen. We’ve taken a
great many beavers, coons, minks, and otters, and
the fur is all prime, for we didn’t begin till the fur
was good. It will be good about three weeks
longer, till May. If we go now, we can get out of
the woods to the nearest road, and haul our furs
on the sledges, by going twice over the road, or
we can stay and trap as long as the fur is good,
build canoes, and, by carrying round the falls,
take the furs and all our truck right to our own
doors.”</p>

<p>“I,” said Joe, “go in for staying till the very
last minute, trapping the very last beaver, and
then taking to the water.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>The boys were clamorous for going by water.</p>

<p>“It will be nothing,” said Uncle Isaac, “to
carry our canoes and furs round the falls, to what it
would to haul the sledges over the soft snow; and
then, when we get out of the woods, we shall find
the snow gone, have to leave them, and come after
them with teams.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the excitement of this wild,
fresh life in the woods, the boys had by no means
lost sight of the great object of their efforts&mdash;the
fitting away of the Hard-Scrabble.</p>

<p>“Uncle Isaac,” asked Charlie, “how much do
you suppose these furs are worth?”</p>

<p>“Well, I never like to crow till I have got out
of the woods; but it is remarkable, it is, our luck.”</p>

<p>“How much? Do tell us!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll have to make any wooden
shrouds.”</p>

<p>“Shall we have enough to rig the vessel?”</p>

<p>“How much, Charlie, do you suppose these
silver-gray fox-skins are worth?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Forty dollars apiece for the real silvers, and
the silver-gray twenty-five.”</p>

<p>“O, my! and the beaver-skins?”</p>

<p>“About six dollars apiece.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<p>Beaver fur, notwithstanding it was plenty, was
in far more request than at present, as it was then
the only material for nice hats; but silk has since
taken its place, beaver being too heavy a fur for
wearing.</p>

<p>“And the coons?” asked John.</p>

<p>“One dollar apiece. The bears about forty
shillings.”</p>

<p>“Why, the bears alone will come to about ten
pounds!”</p>

<p>“The otter?”</p>

<p>“The otter six dollars, and the fisher six.”</p>

<p>“Mink and muskrats?”</p>

<p>“About two shillings for a mink; muskrat,
seventy-five cents.”</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said Uncle Isaac, “we’ve made
nearly a hundred dollars a month apiece, and
shall be here a little short of five months. We
shan’t get many more beaver, but we shall get
more otter, may get another silver-gray fox, and
lots of muskrats.”</p>

<p>“Then,” cried Charlie, jumping to his feet,
“we’ve got enough.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! yes,” said John; “and we’ve got all
summer left to earn more in.”</p>

<p>“How much do you calculate it’s going to take
to fit her for sea?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>“Fifteen hundred dollars&mdash;three hundred seventy-five
apiece.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take it. You’ve made too large a calculation,
though it’s an excellent plan to make a
large calculation. You’ve gone upon the supposition
of paying the regular price for labor and canvas.
It ain’t going to cost you the trade price for
canvas, by a great deal, nor for making the sails,
fitting the rigging, and putting it on. I tell you,
if we get home safe, you’ll have enough to give
her the best of rigging, cables, and anchors, and
enough left to load, provision her for a voyage, and
pay the crew.”</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac now exerted all the craft he was
master of to trap another silver fox; but, notwithstanding
all his arts, the essences and other
attractions he used, his efforts were for a long time
fruitless. At length he built a booth, and, having
first removed every vestige of offal from around
the camp, he roasted a beaver, and besmeared it
with medicine, then dragged the bloody neck of a
deer just killed around the bait, and into the
woods, and lay in wait several nights. He finally
shot his fox, which he knew was in the vicinity, as
he had seen him several times, which was the occasion
of his taking so much pains.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p>Having accomplished this to his heart’s content,
and exclaiming, “What will Sam and Captain
Rhines say to that!” he avowed he would not
bait another trap, but instantly set himself to
hunting for canoe birch. He was not long in
finding one&mdash;though at the present day they are
so rare that the Eastern Indians have pretty much
abandoned the use and construction of canoes&mdash;of
sufficient size, bare of branches for several feet,
and free from cracks and knots, and, with his knife
and a sharp wedge, carefully peeled the bark from
the trunk. It was a slow process, requiring great
care, for this canoe, which was designed to carry
most of the furs and provisions, was to be thirty-four
feet long. In this labor all united, under the
direction of Uncle Isaac. They next procured
long strips of cedar, split with the frow from a
straight-grained log,&mdash;four of them,&mdash;which were
to form the gunwales, an inch thick and two inches
wide, also a large number of strips for linings, an
inch thick and two inches wide, strips of ash for
ribs, half an inch thick and two inches wide, and
spruce roots soaked in hot water for thread.
When all these materials were procured, they
were carried to a level piece of ground near the
camp. While the boys, with their knives, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
shaping and smoothing the sheathing and timbers,
and stripping the spruce roots into thread, Uncle
Isaac, aided by Joe, modelled the canoe. They
set up four stakes in the ground, two at each end,
nearly as far apart as the canoe was to be long,
and laid the bark on the ground between them,
with the side that went next to the wood outside,
the ends brought together and put between
the stakes, then bound four of the cedar strips
together by pairs in several places with roots, then
bound the ends together to form the gunwales,
and fastened them to the stakes. The ribs were
then laid across the bark on the ground, the longest
in the middle, and decreasing gradually towards
each end. Stones were placed upon the middle of
these to keep them down, the ends were then successively
bent up and tucked between the gunwale
strips, and fastened very near together. Other
strips were then placed outside of these, lengthwise,
and where they lapped, nicely bevelled,
forming an outside covering, like the planks of a
vessel. They were to keep the ribs in their
places, and strengthen the structure.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac now elevated each end by putting a
stone under in two places, to give a proper curve.
He then went all over his work, pulling up or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
shoving down the ribs that were placed between
the gunwales, and thus shaping her to suit his eye,
till, being satisfied with his efforts, he fastened
several of the ribs securely to the inner rail strip
to preserve the shape, and bringing up the bark,
fitted it between the strips, and sewed it with
roots, through both the bark and the ribs.</p>

<p>A number of bars were now put across, their
ends brought against the rail, and sewed to it.
The seams in the bark, at the ends and along the
sides, were sewed, and then payed over with
spruce gum mixed with charcoal dust.</p>

<p>The boys enjoyed themselves much at this work,
as it was the very thing they had resolved to do in
their summer holiday, with which the building of
the Hard-Scrabble had so rudely interfered.</p>

<p>“I calculate to give these canoes to you boys; so
I suppose you want them made in style.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Uncle Isaac,” said Charlie, “because,
you know, we shall be asked who made
them.”</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac boiled the moss of a tree in water
in which the roots of wild gooseberries had been
boiled, and made a red dye. In this he colored
porcupine quills; others he colored blue and green,
with other barks and roots, the names of which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
would not tell, and ornamented the canoe and
stained the paddles. The canoe was thirty-four
feet long, four and a half wide, and nearly three
deep.</p>

<p>“I’ll warrant her to carry twenty-five hundred,”
said Uncle Isaac.</p>

<p>They now built a smaller one, and packing their
furs, furnished themselves with moose meat, smoked
and dried, for provision on the way, turned their
backs on the woods, and arrived safely at home in
hoeing time, where Uncle Isaac found his crops
and cattle in fine order, all his affairs having been
intrusted to Ricker during his absence.</p>

<p>When they started for home, John said to Charlie,
as he took up his paddle, “I’ve had woods
enough to last me for a long time, and shall be
contented to go to work.”</p>

<p>“I am only sorry,” said Charlie, “that I couldn’t
find a bear’s cub that I could take home with me.”

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>THE HARD-SCRABBLE WEIGHS ANCHOR.&mdash;CHARLIE
GETS MARRIED.</small></h2>

<p>During their absence Captain Rhines and Ben
had filled Fred’s store with goods, to be sold on
half profits, which enabled him to furnish his
portion of the money without any detriment to
his business.</p>

<p>Isaac having left a draw-bill, Mr. Welch had
sent to Captain Rhines the money that belonged
to him. The sails were done, and the boards to
load the sloop were sawed. Letters had been
received from Isaac, stating that he should not be
at home till March. Thus they had abundance of
time.</p>

<p>Captain Rhines took the furs to New York in
the Perseverance, sold them there for a high price,&mdash;there
was a great foreign demand, and furs
were up,&mdash;and bought the rigging.</p>

<p>They found the vessel was so buoyant that the
lumber they had cut would not load her. Captain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
Rhines advised them to carry part of a deck-load
of spars.</p>

<p>John went to Portland, and Charlie began to
clear a portion of his place large enough to set a
house, and for a small field, it being just the time
of year to fall trees while the leaves were on.</p>

<p>As Charlie was in hopes to have use for his timber
in ship-building, he did not wish to burn it up,
and therefore cleared but a small portion.</p>

<p>Ben and Charlie worked together. One week
they worked on Elm Island, and the next on
Pleasant Point. There was also another attraction
at Elm Island&mdash;<i>a baby</i>. The time passed pleasantly
with Charlie. The cherry and apple trees
he had planted in the garden were in blossom;
and, though he had outgrown his playthings in
some measure, he had by no means outgrown his
love for the children, who, falling heirs to all these
treasures, enjoyed them with the highest relish.</p>

<p>The vessel was rigged in the course of the summer
by Captain Rhines and Ben, and the rigging
thoroughly stretched in the hot weather.</p>

<p>When John arrived at Portland, he found that
Mr. Starrett had bought the cables and anchors of
a vessel cast away at Gay Head, larger somewhat
than the Hard-Scrabble, but nearly new. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
were sold at auction for a reduced price; also a
dipsey-lead and line, chest of tools, and compasses.</p>

<p>When the snow came, Charlie cut and hauled
out spars enough to complete the deck-load of the
vessel; but, although they piled them up ten feet
above deck, they could not bring her deck to the
water, she was so buoyant.</p>

<p>Captain March, as we must call him now, came
home just as they were completing the lading.</p>

<p>John came home to see Isaac off, and to settle
up the business. The crew were shipped, as in the
Ark, for nominal wages and a privilege.</p>

<p>Sally had a liberal allowance of room given to
her for a venture.</p>

<p>Peterson went before the mast, and his boy
went as cook. Isaac persuaded Joe Griffin and
Henry to go with him, Joe as mate. The rest
of the crew were made up of the neighbors’ boys.</p>

<p>When they came to settle accounts, they found
that the cost of outfit had been brought down to a
thousand dollars, instead of fifteen hundred, as
they estimated at first. There were several reasons
for this. The canvas cost them much less
than it would had they bought it at a warehouse.
Captain Rhines had bought the rigging in New
York, where he was well acquainted, cheap. Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Starrett had bought the cables and anchors for
two thirds price, and would take no commission.
Captain Rhines and Ben charged very low wages
for making the sails, fitting and putting on the
rigging, and the boys could not make them take
any more.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the advantage of you now, boys,”
said the captain. “You wouldn’t let us lend you
money, but you can’t make us take more for our
work than we like.”</p>

<p>On this account they were able to settle all their
bills, provision the vessel for the voyage, load her,
and even have something left, which exceeded
their most sanguine expectations.</p>

<p>Isaac, whose proportion had all been paid in
cash, had remaining but four dollars. John had
nine shillings of the money resulting from his venture
in the Ark, and the proceeds of hunting,
although he had some wages due him in Portland.
Fred, who had paid nearly every dollar of his proportion
in orders, except what the cargo cost, could
have advanced seventy-five dollars more without
detriment to his business; while Charlie was better
off in respect to ready money than either of them.
There was sufficient reason for this. His wages as
master workman had been more than the rest, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
he had worked all the time in the winter making
the spars, rudder, and windlass, and building the
boats. He had also furnished the timber and spars
for the cargo of the vessel. Fred could not pay
this in orders; so he and the others had to pay
Charlie one hundred and fifty dollars apiece in
money, which left him better off than they, as he
had his farm and a fourth of the vessel, while
Isaac’s goods were the greater part on commission,
and belonged to Captain Rhines, Ben, and Uncle
Isaac.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant morning when the vessel
weighed anchor, a fair wind, a little quartering,
just right to make every sail draw; and all the
population that could get there were assembled
around the banks of Captain Rhines’s Cove. They
had a singular fashion before, and for many years
after, the revolution,&mdash;even till 1812 and later,&mdash;of
rigging vessels into topsail sloops, and even sent
them to the East Indies.</p>

<p>The old sloop Messenger, of Portland, and
Stock, of Boston, owned by the Messrs. Parsons,
were of this class.</p>

<p>The Hard-Scrabble presented a novel sight on
that morning, and well did her appearance correspond
to her name. As the sun shone upon her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
sides, wherever they were out of water, it revealed
a streak of black and a streak of white, where the
black pitch and white wood alternated. Her sails,
though well made, of good material, and setting
well, were the color of flax, not being bleached.
Her lower mast was rather short in proportion to
the top, top-gallant, and royal masts. The mainmast
was set well aft, and raked a good deal. The
bowsprit and jib-boom were long. She had a spritsail
yard and double martingale. The fore-braces
led to the end of the bowsprit, the others to the
end of the jib-boom. In bad weather they had preventer-braces
that led aft to the rail. She carried
fore-topmast staysail, jib, and flying-jib. She had
no sail on the lower yard, because, when they
built her, they did not think they could afford it.
Had they known how they were coming out,
Charlie would have done it.</p>

<p>All the paint on her was the lamp-black and oil
with which her name was put on, and a little more,
where Ben had painted it on the brunt of her topsail.
She was stowed so full of lumber that the
men could only heave forward of the windlass, and
it was piled so high that the mainsail was obliged
to be reefed, and a false saddle put on to keep the
boom up; while in glaring contrast to the rest of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
the structure was the beautiful boat, which Charlie
had built to show what he could do, gayly painted,
on the davits, and for which he had made a mast
and sail.</p>

<p>In the warm sunshine, under lee of a high ledge
that sheltered them from the wind, were seated
Captain Rhines’s folks, Uncle Isaac and his wife,
Ben and Sally, the boys, and old Mrs. Yelf, who
was gazing with great complacency upon the royal
her old fingers had woven,&mdash;a labor of love,&mdash;as
it swelled out in the fresh breeze, and also Tige
Rhines, a few paces in front, a most interested and
observant spectator.</p>

<p>As she faded from view, and the forms of Isaac
and Joe, standing on the quarter, could no longer
be recognized, the boys turned their eyes upon
each other in silence.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Uncle Isaac, at length, laying
his hand upon Charlie’s shoulder, “it’s been a hard
scrabble; but you’ve done it, and she’s gone to seek
her fortune and yours. May the Lord be with
them!”</p>

<p>“You’ve done it, too, without the old folks,” said
the captain; “and that, I suppose, makes it the
sweeter.”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t, Captain Rhines,” said Fred.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
“I never should have been able to have built my
part of her without the old folks.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have had anything,” said John, “if
it hadn’t been for the folks that built the Ark, and
carried my venture,&mdash;went into the woods, and
showed me how to hunt and trap.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” said Charlie, “I never should have
had anything, or been anything but a poor, forlorn
castaway, if it had not been for father and mother,
Captain Rhines, Uncle Isaac, and Joe,&mdash;yes, and
everybody round here. And wasn’t mother the
means of making the sails?”</p>

<p>“You may try as hard as you like to make out
that you are not good for much,” said Ben; “but
you’ll have hard work to make us, or anybody else,
believe it.”</p>

<p>“Well, father, it makes boys smart to have
friends to love them, encourage, and show them;
tell them they are smart, and say ‘stuboy,’ to
have plenty to eat, and see a little chance to do
something for themselves, and folks trying to make
them happy. If a boy has got anything in him, it
must come out.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Uncle Isaac. “And if there ain’t
anything, it can’t come out.”</p>

<p>After the rest had gone, the boys sat watching
the vessel till she mingled with the thin air.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span></p>

<p>“Now, I’m glad we’ve done as we did,” said
Charlie. “We might have hired the money of
father, or Captain Rhines, have sent the vessel off,
and, perhaps, paid for her, and paid them; but
suppose she had made nothing, or been lost&mdash;then
we should have been in debt, and felt mean enough;
now she is ours, and paid for; if she is lost, we owe
nobody: we’ve learned a good deal, and are young
enough to earn more money.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do now, John?”</p>

<p>“Going back to Portland.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to go to Stroudwater. Mr.
Foss wants me: he’s going to build two vessels.”</p>

<p>“I know what he wants to do,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Get married.”</p>

<p>“Well, so I do, awfully.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said John, “why don’t you do it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Fred. “It’s a leisure time now: the
snow is about gone, and we’ll all turn to and put
you up a log house in no time.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Charlie. Come, you are the oldest;
set a good example: I’ll raise the crew. Fred
wants to follow suit.”</p>

<p>“I’m a good mind to build a log house before I
go to Portland;” which resolution was the result
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
of many previous conversations with Mary Rhines,
in which they had determined to begin, as Ben
and Sally, Joe Griffin and his wife, had done. The
boys took good care not to let his resolution cool,
but instantly set off, post-haste, for Captain Rhines’s,
where they found Ben, Sally, and Uncle Isaac,
and, taking them aside, commended the affair to
them. Uncle Isaac needed no prompting, and in
a fortnight the house was built, differing in no
wise from Joe’s, except that it had a chimney
and glazed windows, which Captain Rhines declared
they should have: he said the bricks and the windows
would do for another house.</p>

<p>John now started for Portland, and Charlie for
Stroudwater, in order to earn all he could before
settling down. He was never satisfied unless he
could be making some improvement. In Portland
(on his way to Stroudwater) he saw a vessel that
had put in for a harbor. It was built for a privateer
in the war, and of a most beautiful model.</p>

<p>He ascertained her proportions, and, after he
went to work at Stroudwater, amused himself
with trying to imitate her with a block of wood,
making a half model, and got so much interested
that he went into Portland to compare his
work with the original, till he got it as accurate as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
possible; then he put a stem, keel, and stern-post
on, and painted it, intending to give it to Bennie
for a plaything, and, putting it up on a brace in the
shop, thought no more about it; but one stormy
day, sitting in the shop, and thinking about the
proportions of a vessel he had been at work upon,
his eye fell upon the model. A new idea was instantly
suggested; he leaped from his seat, took
square and compass, divided the model accurately
into pieces an inch in thickness from stem to stern,
then took a fine saw, and sawed it all up. He then
planed a board smooth, fastened the keel, stem,
and stern-post of his model on to it, placed inside
of them the blocks corresponding to the forward,
after, and midship frames, and several others between
them, and fastened them to the board; he found
he could, by placing his square on these blocks,
obtain a water-line along her side, follow the model,
shape his vessel accurately, and know just what
kind of a vessel he was going to have when he was
done. Here was an end to his sweeps on the
beach, tumbling in timbers, and guessing, to a great
extent. He had got a skeleton model, the latest
improvement till the present one of close models.</p>

<p>While he was contemplating his work, Mr. Foss
came along: he showed it to him. The old carpenter
saw it in a moment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>“Charlie,” said he, “you’ve made a great improvement.
I undertook to learn you, and you
have learned me. That’s a great thing: that’s
going to save money, time, and timber. With the
rising line and shortening line, you can model and
build a vessel, and know what you are going to do.
I’ll give you the dimensions of this vessel we are
getting the timber for, and I want you to make a
model of her.”</p>

<p>“I will try it.”</p>

<p>Charlie modelled, and was successful. He returned
home in June, and was married. He found
that the trees which he had girdled in the fall had
leaved; but the leaves were most of them small
and withering. He had drawn a cordon, many
rods in width, all around the buildings, and especially
round the little peninsula, in the midst of
which towered the great elm, sparing a handsome
tree every now and then, so that after the girdled
trees had fallen down, and been removed, they
might be out of the reach of fires.</p>

<p>Charlie had been married but a few weeks when
the young pair made their appearance at Elm
Island.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Charlie, “do you remember one
night, when I first bought my place, I came home
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
from there, you asked me what was the matter,
and I put you off?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I saw you’d been crying, and that was
what made me ask you.”</p>

<p>“I had been thinking about old times, and my
mother. I wanted then, and I want now, as I
have got settled on my place, to go to St. John,
and get her body, and have her buried under an
elm there is there. It is a lovely spot: it was almost
the first thing that came into my mind when
I saw the place, and that was what I had been
crying about. When she died, I followed her to
the grave in rags, no one to go with me but the
Irish woman of whom we hired the room: she was
a good-hearted woman, poor herself, but did what
she could for us. Many a crust has she given me;
and if she is living, I’ll let her know I haven’t forgotten
it. Mother, now that I have a home of my
own, I can’t rest any longer to have her lie in that
miserable corner, among the worst of creatures, the
place all grown up with bushes. I want to bring
her here.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I would, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“Do you think father would go with me?”</p>

<p>“Go! to be sure he would. The Perseverance
is out fishing now, but she will be in soon; she is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
only hired for one trip. I tell you what you do,
Charlie: after haying, bring Mary over here, and
leave her; you and Ben take the schooner, and go.
When you get back, we’ll all of us attend the
funeral, have the minister preach a sermon, and
everything done as it should be; but two is not
enough: there ought to be three.”</p>

<p>“We can run into Portland, and get John. I
would rather have him go with us than anybody
else.”</p>

<p>The noble boy accomplished his object, and
deposited the ashes of the mother so dear to him
in the spot he had chosen. It was a sweet resting-place:
the branches of the majestic tree, green in
the first verdure of summer, almost swept the
grave; the brook murmured gently as it rounded
the little promontory; the ground-sparrow built
her nest, and reared her young, upon the turf that
covered it; and the low-voiced summer winds
breathed requiems over the sainted dead.</p>

<p>Often, on Sabbath evenings, as Charlie, with his
young wife, visited the spot, did he lift up his
heart in gratitude to Him who had given him a
home, friends, and land of his own, and enabled
him to pay the last tokens of affection to the
mother he so dearly loved. Gratifying the tastes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
he had acquired in his native land, and aided by
his wife, he surrounded the spot with flowers and
shrubbery.</p>

<p>Charlie’s marriage, so far from involving him in
any additional expense, increased his facilities for
acquiring; for he had married one who was indeed
a helpmeet. Captain Rhines would have furnished
his daughter abundantly; but she, like John, preferred
to earn it herself.</p>

<p>“I never saw such children as mine are,” said the
captain. “They won’t let me do anything for them.”</p>

<p>“Wait, father,” said Mary, “till we get a frame-house,
and our land cleared. We may burn this
up, and it is good enough for that: besides, father,
I know how Charlie feels; he abhors the idea of
marrying on; he will feel a good deal better to get
under way himself: you know, you can give me
any time, if you want to. Charlie, John, and Fred
are all alike about being helped.”</p>

<p>The very first thing Charlie did after he got into
his house was to set a bear-trap; the next, to make
a loom and all the fixtures for Mary. Some years
before, her father had given her a pair of sheep,
and now she had quite a flock, and had made blankets
and other articles for housekeeping before her
marriage; her mother had furnished her with flax,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
and the hum of her wheel kept time with the
strokes of Charlie’s hammer, as he worked on his
boats. He brought over a host of hens from Elm
Island; but ducks and geese he didn’t dare to
bring, the foxes were so plenty and destructive;
but he calculated to trap them, and did hope the
bears would get into his corn. O, how he did
want to go into farming, down with trees, put in
the fire, and raise corn and grain! But then he
wanted to save his shade trees, and had a contract
to build a lot of boats for vessels that were building
in Portland. This paid better than farming,
and must be done right off; therefore he must
defer the gratification; so he hired Ricker to help
him, and set to work upon his boats. Thus employed
we must leave him, to follow the fortunes
of Captain Murch, in the Hard-Scrabble.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>STRIKING WHILE THE IRON’S HOT.</small></h2>

<p>The Hard-Scrabble had a good run off the
coast, holding the wind to the edge of the Gulf
Stream; proved herself an excellent sea boat, and,
although so deep loaded, a good sailer. It was
evident that, light, she was faster than ordinary.</p>

<p>France and England were then at war. Napoleon’s
star was just rising above the horizon, and
our young captain found he had arrived at the rich
Island of Martinique in a most favorable time. But
few American vessels were there, barracks were
building for troops, boards were wanted, and there
was a great demand for small spars, as masts for
drogers, booms for French men-of-war that came
in there to refit after the conflicts that were constantly
occurring between the hostile fleets.</p>

<p>Isaac sold his boards for forty dollars per thousand,
and obtained a hogshead of molasses for a small
spar which cost little more than the expense of
cutting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>“I wish I had loaded her with spars,” said Isaac
to his mate.</p>

<p>“You’ll make money enough,” said Joe, “as it
is: you ought to be satisfied. But I wish I’d
brought spars for a venture.”</p>

<p>Isaac now bought iron, and thoroughly bolted
his knees, and, heaving the vessel out, butt-bolted
the plank, and painted her upper works. The fastening
was put in by him and his mate; for Isaac
was possessed of all the native ingenuity of his
uncle for handling tools.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Griffin,” said he, “we need not fear
to put the molasses in her, and we’ll see if we can’t
bring her scuppers to the water.”</p>

<p>Just as they were ready to take in molasses, a
French man-of-war came in, that had been disabled
in an action with an English frigate. As she lay
in the offing, the commander sent his lieutenant
aboard the Hard-Scrabble, to see if she had
brought any spars that would make him a main-yard.
The lieutenant informed Isaac that they
had broken the spar nearly off in trying to escape
from the enemy, but that they had fished, and
made it answer a temporary purpose; that they
must have a spar, if it could be procured, no matter
what the price.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

<p>“Where is it injured?” asked Isaac; “in the
slings?”</p>

<p>“No; well out on the quarter: it was a poor
stick; there were some large knots in it, and it
broke square, without splintering; that is, it cracked,
though it didn’t come in two.”</p>

<p>Isaac replied that he would come on board in
the course of an hour, and see the captain.</p>

<p>“What is the use to go aboard?” said Joe;
“you haven’t got a thing but a spar you’ve saved
for a derrick, and haven’t brought anything that
would make him even a royal mast.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t so sure of that. Come down below,
Joe.” When they were by themselves, he said,
“Joe, suppose I should offer him the mainmast;
could you and I get her home?”</p>

<p>After reflecting a moment, he replied, “Go
ahead, captain: it will be summer time; we shall
have southerly winds, and we’ve got provisions
enough.”</p>

<p>“But what will the crew say? We’ve no right
to disable the vessel, and run the risk of losing
her, and their lives, without their consent.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll give me authority to offer them a
hogshead of molasses apiece, I’ll make ’em willing,
and more than willing.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<p>Joe went forward, got the men together, and
broached the matter. They not only made no
objection, but received the proposition with
cheers.</p>

<p>“We’ll put it all into Fred’s store, boys,” said
Henry Griffin, “and let him sell it for us on commission&mdash;sweeten
him well.”</p>

<p>Isaac lowered the boat Charlie had made,&mdash;whose
rowing and sailing qualities attracted the
attention of all in the harbor,&mdash;put four oars in
her, and went on board the man-of-war in good
shape.</p>

<p>There was a very kindly feeling existing at that
time between us and the French, who had aided
us in the struggle for independence.</p>

<p>The French commander received Isaac with all
the politeness of his nation. Isaac went aloft, and
looked at the spar. It was just as the lieutenant
had stated. When he came down, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Captain, I haven’t any spars; didn’t bring any
but small ones; but I’ll sell you my mainmast.”</p>

<p>“But if you sell your mast,” cried the Frenchman,
in astonishment, “how are you to get
home?”</p>

<p>“That is my own lookout.”</p>

<p>“What strange people you Americans are!
But is it large enough?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>“It’s eighty feet long and twenty-eight inches
through.”</p>

<p>“That is long enough,” said the Frenchman.
“It is a very little shorter than the old yard, but
will answer, as the sail does not haul out. It is
more than large enough.”</p>

<p>“It is a very good stick&mdash;worth two of your
old one.”</p>

<p>“But to take your mast out of your vessel
you will ask a great price.”</p>

<p>“If you will take it out,&mdash;for I have no purchase
sufficient,&mdash;give me your old spar and a thousand
dollars, you may have it.”</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars!” interrupted the lieutenant.
“That is more than your whole craft is
worth.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so to you, but not so to me. Besides,
I risk my life, and that of my men, and my cargo,
by disabling my vessel.”</p>

<p>“I must have the spar, and I’ll give you the
money,” said the captain.</p>

<p>He invited Isaac to take wine with him, which
he declined.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen strange things to-day,” said the
Frenchman. “A captain that would sell the mast
out of his vessel, and wouldn’t drink a glass of
wine.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>In the intercourse which grew out of this trade,
the Frenchman noticed Isaac’s boat,&mdash;his own had
been riddled with shot,&mdash;and he wanted to buy
her.</p>

<p>“There’s not a boat in this harbor,” said Isaac,
“that can pull or sail with her. I’ll sell her. I’ll
sell anything but my country and my principles.
If you want her enough to give me one hundred
dollars for her, take her.”</p>

<p>The Frenchman took her. The boatswain’s
crew of the man-of-war brought the yard alongside,
and took out the mast.</p>

<p>Isaac and Joe got the spar on board, sawed it
off square where it was cracked, then took a whip-saw
and split it into halves the whole length,
turned the halves end for end, and put it together
again, thus bringing the joint in another place, and
making the spar just as long as it was before, and
then treenailed it together.</p>

<p>A yard is differently shaped from a mast, being
biggest in the middle. By their turning the halves,
although the length was the same, there was a slag
in the place of the joint, and a bunch at the ends.
They filled up the slag with plank, the bunch at
the bottom helped out the step of the mast, and
that at the top to form the masthead. They then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
put on the hounds and the old trestle-trees. Joe,
who was no mean blacksmith, hooped the whole
with iron, above and below the wake of the mainsail.
They now put in the mast, and set up the
rigging.</p>

<p>As the mast was so much smaller than the
other, they did not dare to send up the top and
top-gallant masts; but they gave additional strength
to the masts by putting the topmast backstays and
also the headstays on to the head of the lower
mast, thus leaving the stays of the two masts on
one, to compensate for the smaller size of the spar.
They were not afraid now to carry a whole mainsail
and fore-staysail. They also sent up the fore-yard,
and bent the topsail on it for a square-sail.</p>

<p>In order that she might not look stunt, Joe made
a light spar to take the place of a topmast, to set
colors on. They put the top-gallant rigging and
backstays on it, and the flying-jib for a gaff-topsail.
Thus they had nearly as much sail as before, and
all the large sails, without cutting a foot of rigging
or a yard of canvas.</p>

<p>“It takes us ‘Hard-Scrabble boys’ to do things,”
said Joe, when the whole was completed. “Hurrah
for the Hard-Scrabble!” and jumping on to
the windlass-bitts at one bound, and slapping his
hands against his sides, he crowed most lustily.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p>Mails were now established by Congress, and
communication was more easy. The boys were
impatiently awaiting news from Isaac. They did
not manifest the patient endurance of Ben while
the Ark was gone, but were running to the office
every mail day.</p>

<p>At length word came from John that Captain
Crabtree had arrived, bringing news that Isaac had
sold his lumber for forty dollars per thousand, got
a hogshead of molasses for a spar, sold Charlie’s
boat for one hundred dollars, and Sally’s venture
for ninety-six, and had agreed to sell his mast to
the captain of a French frigate for a mainmast for
a thousand dollars, and was coming home under
jury-masts, and that Crabtree came away then.</p>

<p>When Mr. Welch heard of it, he declared he
should have a ship when he got back if he had to
buy one for him.</p>

<p>“You can’t have him,” said Captain Rhines.
“You ought to have held on to him when you
had him. He belongs to the boys.”</p>

<p>“But the boys can’t build him an Indiaman.”</p>

<p>“Can’t they? I’d like to know what they can’t
do! Besides, they’ll have good backers. I’ve
been in both kinds of business, and it’s my opinion
there’s more to be made in West India than there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
is in East India business, at any rate while this
war lasts, though it may not have so large a sound
and be quite so genteel, which goes a great ways
with <i>some people</i>.”</p>

<p>“Especially if you can raise your own cargoes,
build your own ships, make your own rigging,
and weave your own sails,” added Mr. Welch,
laughing.</p>

<p>In a few days they had a letter from Isaac, telling
the particulars, saying that they were ready to
take in cargo; and he wanted Charlie to have a
mast all made and ready to go in when he got
home, and a load of spars for men-of-war, lower
masts, yards, and smaller spars; that he would take
a few large ones on deck, and go to Cadiz,&mdash;for the
Spaniards were in the war, and spars were high
there,&mdash;and would load back with salt. He said
all hands were well, the vessel tight, sailed and
worked first rate; and he had got a bag of coffee
for old Mrs. Yelf.</p>

<p>“I can get the mast fast enough on Elm
Island,” said Charlie, “roll it into the water, and
tow it over; but how does he think I’m going to
haul those heavy spars on bare ground, enough
to load that sloop?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how,” said Ricker. “You know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
that place where the brook goes right through a
gap in the ledge?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, make a pair of gates to open and shut
in that gap, dam the water, and flow it back, till
the brook is deep enough to float the timber, then
twitch and roll it into the pond, float it down to
the gates, open them, and down it will go into the
cove, right alongside your vessel. I know all
about that work. I never did much else.”</p>

<p>“That will be just the thing,” said Charlie, “for
some of the largest trees grow within half a gunshot
of the pond.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to stir yourselves,” said Captain
Rhines. “The way he’s rigged that vessel, according
to his letter, he won’t be much longer than
common on the passage.”</p>

<p>“I wish Joe Griffin was here,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s done you more good where
he is.”</p>

<p>Charlie obtained men, got his gates made, his
mast cut and made, and part of the spars cut,
when the sloop arrived in Boston.</p>

<p>When she was again ready for sea, she presented
quite a different appearance. They finished her
cabin, put a billet-head on her, painted her hull and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
spars, put studding-sail booms on her yards. The
decks were worn smooth, and the sails bleached
white. She had a square-sail, and looked like another
vessel.</p>

<p>Pluck and principle win the day. The cargo
which they carried out in this rough craft, built of
white pine, and half fastened, amounted to eleven
thousand seventy-five dollars, bought their homeward
cargo, and left them three hundred dollars in
cash. The mast Isaac sold to the Frenchman paid
all the expenses of the voyage within fifty dollars,
and, after selling their molasses, left them cash and
sales twenty-six thousand six hundred and five
dollars, six thousand six hundred fifty-one dollars
and twenty-five cents apiece, Charlie having one
hundred dollars more, the price of the boat, half
of which he gave to Joe, Captain Rhines, and
Ben, put glass windows in the meeting-house, and
clapboarded it. Uncle Isaac and others built a
steeple. The boys gave a bell, and Isaac brought
a bag of coffee and a barrel of sugar for Parson
Goodhue.</p>

<p>During the fall and winter Charlie cut spars
enough to freight the sloop again, and built a few
boats.</p>

<p>The Hard-Scrabble returned, having made a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
profitable voyage; and, as the spring opened,
Charlie had leisure to attend to farming. He
planted among the trees, whose naked branches
flung no shadow, and whose dead limbs and seasoned
trunks, continually dropping, afforded an
inexhaustible supply of dry fuel.</p>

<p>At leisure intervals he hewed out timber for a
house and barn frame; and, as he now had money,
hired Ricker, and, after the harvest was gathered
in the fall, cut down and burned up all the dry
trunks of the trees, when the ground was wet, and
there was no risk of the fires running.</p>

<p>He now had a large belt of cleared land between
the grove&mdash;behind which he had resolved to
place his permanent buildings&mdash;and the great elm
and forest, also many beautiful trees scattered here
and there over the slope trending to the shore.</p>

<p>“It has made some work,” said he, “to save
these trees; but they are a life-long source of
beauty and happiness.”</p>

<p>As the next spring opened, he was about to
attack the forest in earnest, when his plans were
entirely changed by a communication from Captain
Rhines and Uncle Isaac.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>PROGRESS.</small></h2>

<p>Charlie now possessed what in those days was
considered a handsome property.</p>

<p>As the spring came on, he made sugar, and
determined to cut and burn the growth of white
maple, birch, and ash that covered the flat, that he
might have field pasturage, and indulge his taste
for farming. But his plans were brought to a
sudden termination, and the land was to be cleared
in a manner quite different from that which he had
anticipated.</p>

<p>About four o’clock one afternoon, as he and
Ricker were grinding their axes, in preparation for
the morrow, Ben, Captain Rhines, Uncle Isaac,
and Fred landed in the cove. As Charlie went
to meet them, Fred held up a letter.</p>

<p>“We’ve come to set you to work,” said Captain
Rhines. “We were afraid that, living here by
yourself, with plenty of money, you would get
rusty and lazy.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p>“I was afraid I should myself, and so am getting
ready to go into the woods. Come, go into the
house, all of you.”</p>

<p>The letter was from Isaac. He was at Cadiz,
waiting for a cargo of salt.</p>

<p>“He says he wants a larger vessel; that the
demand is for large spars for men-of-war, lower
masts, yards, and bowsprits; that he can’t carry
them in that vessel, and that the few he did carry
he had to run over the rail forward and aft, and
he liked to have lost his vessel going out by one
getting adrift.”</p>

<p>“How large a vessel does he want, Captain
Rhines?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Seven hundred tons,&mdash;a proper mast ship,&mdash;large
enough to carry real whoppers, one hundred
and eight feet long and thirty-six inches through,
with a port at each end big enough to drive in a
yoke of oxen.”</p>

<p>Neither Charlie, nor even Fred, who thought the
Hard-Scrabble a monster for size, seemed startled
by this.</p>

<p>“Is he in a hurry for her?”</p>

<p>“No; he said he wanted you to be thinking
about it; and he will let the masts alone, and take
fish, boards, and staves to Madeira, or some of the
Danish islands.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>“I will go to cutting the timber to-morrow. I’d
rather cut it into ship-timber than burn it. It
won’t be fifty rods from the yard. As I am
clearing, I can save what I come across, and set up
the vessel in the fall, if he is in no hurry. Who’ll
be the owners?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Welch, Ben, Uncle Isaac, myself, and you
‘Hard-Scrabble boys.’ There’s eight of us. We’ll
all own alike. Give her a hard-wood floor, white
oak top, buy the timber of you, and take her at
the bills.”</p>

<p>“I’m agreed. What’s the dimensions?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got them here. Isaac has seen an English
mast ship out there, and sent home her proportions.
But you must build a two-story frame-house first
to lodge your men. You’ll want fifty or sixty men
before you get through.”</p>

<p>“I can get along with a log house&mdash;make it
bigger. Some can sleep in the barn in warm
weather. I want something else a great deal
more than I do a frame-house.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“A saw-mill right on this brook, where I can
saw all my deck, ceiling, outboard plank, and
waterways.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” said Uncle Isaac. “I go in for
a mill. I’ll build in it, and work on it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<p>“I hope you won’t have a wooden crank,” said
Fred.</p>

<p>“Nor tread back with the foot,” said Ben, “like
this old rattle-trap on the river.”</p>

<p>“There’s water and fall enough,” said Captain
Rhines; “and we’ll have an iron crank if we send
to England for it, and all the modern improvements.
I move that Charlie, Ricker, Yelf, and Joe
Griffin go to work hewing the timber; and that
we send Uncle Isaac off to the westward to learn
the new improvements, and come home and
build it.”</p>

<p>Having agreed upon all these matters, they
separated; and that is what became of Charlie’s
farming that year.</p>

<p>The pond, of which the brook was an outlet,
furnishing a steady supply of water, not affected by
droughts, offered a splendid mill privilege. The
dam was almost built by nature, and the labor of
constructing the whole was greatly lessened, as the
timber grew upon the spot.</p>

<p>Instead of going to work upon the mill, Charlie,
who knew that the moment it was noised abroad
that a mill was to be built on the outlet to Beaver
Pond, the price of timber land in the immediate
vicinity would rise, started off to Portsmouth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
where the proprietor lived, and bought the whole
lot, between him and Joe Griffin, which was heavily
timbered with pine and hard wood. It was not
the desire of speculation that influenced him: he
wanted ship-timber, spars, and lumber, and didn’t
want to strip all the forest from his home farm.
Charlie loved the trees: a bare and barren landscape
had no charms for him.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac did not go to the westward to see
the new improvements, but to Thomaston, where
General Knox (with whom he was acquainted,
having served under him in the war of independence)
was building mills, and making all kinds
of improvements.</p>

<p>The general, who was a noble, hospitable man,
received Uncle Isaac most cordially, took him to
his house, and gave him every facility in his power.
He looked over the mills, made his observations,
and took plans of the machinery, came home, and
went to work.</p>

<p>Ricker now proved a most valuable man: he
had been accustomed to mill work, and knew how
to take care of a saw. Since his reformation, he
had renewed his engagement, broken off by his
loose habits. He went home, got married, took
charge of the mill, and went to sawing out plank
for the vessel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p>Charlie built a first-rate frame blacksmith’s shop,
with a brick chimney. John came home, bringing
a complete set of tools.</p>

<p>Fred was fully occupied in getting fish ready
to send in the “Hard-Scrabble” to Madeira, and
exceedingly interested in some timber Ricker
was sawing to order in the mill, and a cellar
Uncle Sam Elwell was stoning not far from his
store.</p>

<p>It was snapping times now all round, everybody
on the clean jump from morning to night. The
mill was going night and day, and the short click
of the saw rang in the still midnight through the
old woods, that had before echoed only to the war-whoop
of the red man, or the blows of the settler’s
axe.</p>

<p>The younger portion of the community were
wide awake, ready for anything, and a spirit of
emulation was rife among them. Walter Griffin,
Fred’s clerk, kicked out of the traces at once; he
went to Fred, and said, “Mr. Williams, I must
leave.”</p>

<p>“Leave!” cried Fred, in amazement. “What
for?”</p>

<p>“I want to go to sea.”</p>

<p>Fred more than liked Walter: he loved him;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
he was a splendid boy, industrious, trustworthy,
and smart; but his wrist-joints were three inches
below the sleeve of his jacket, for his mother
couldn’t make clothes as fast as he grew.</p>

<p>“Why, Walter, I didn’t dream of your ever
leaving me. I want you, when you are older, to
go into business with me. Don’t you like me?”</p>

<p>The tears came into the boy’s eyes in a moment.</p>

<p>“<i>Like</i> you, Mr. Williams! My own father ain’t
nearer to me: you’ve done everything for me; but,
Mr. Williams, I never was made to weigh flour,
measure molasses and cloth; it don’t agree with
our kind of people. I can’t stand it; I shall die:
indeed I can’t.”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t leave me now, when I have
so much to do?”</p>

<p>“Not by any means, sir. I don’t want to go
till the big ship is done.”</p>

<p>“I think you’ll miss it, Walter.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, sir. I don’t see why I can’t do as well
at sea as Isaac Murch. I’ll leave it to Uncle
Isaac.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Isaac, he’s always ready to shove any
boy ahead.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you like to have him shove you ahead
when you was a boy, sir?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span></p>

<p>That was a thrust which Fred knew not how to
parry, and he was silent.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel so bad, Mr. Williams. My brother
William is only eighteen months younger than I
am; he would like to come in here, and would get
well broke in before I shall want to go.”</p>

<p>“But he’s a Griffin, too,” said Fred, despondingly,
“and will clear out just as he becomes
useful.”</p>

<p>When the ship was ready for sea, half the boys
in the neighborhood wanted to go in her. Isaac
took four, and several young men, who had been
some in coasters, as ordinary seamen.</p>

<p>She was called the Casco.</p>

<p>Fred was married to Elizabeth Rhines the day
before she sailed, the wedding being somewhat
hastened, in order that Isaac might be present.</p>

<p>This was a most eventful year. Uncle Isaac,
one Saturday night, created surprise enough by
riding down to the store with his wife in a wagon,
the first one that had ever been seen in the place.</p>

<p>“You’ve got yourself into business, Isaac,” said
the captain. “Either you or Charlie have got to
make me one this winter.”</p>

<p>“Then I must do it, Benjamin; for Charlie’s got
enough to do this winter to take care of that baby.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>Seth Warren assumed command of the Hard-Scrabble,
that still continued to make money for
her owners, who built more vessels, and acquired
property, of which they made a most praiseworthy
use, in affording employment to others, and doing
all in their power to promote the welfare of society;
and the prosperity and happiness of hundreds
resulted from that pile of boards Captain Rhines
navigated to Cuba; and fleet and beautiful vessels,
visiting the most distant seas, were the successors
of the Hard-Scrabble.</p>

<p class="small">“The romance surrounding the adventurous
lives of Western pioneers and immigrants
has suggested nearly as many stories as the
chivalric deeds of knight-errantry. These
tales of frontier life are, however, as a rule,
characterized by such wildness of fancy and
such extravagancy of language that we have
often wondered why another Cervantes did
not ridicule our border romances by describing
a second Don Quixote’s adventures on
the prairies. We are pleased to notice, that
in the new series of Frontier Tales, by Lee
&amp; Shepard, there is an agreeable absence of
sensational writing, of that maudlin sentimentality
which make the generality of such
tales nauseous.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
